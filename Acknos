\section*{Acknowledgements}
We are very thankful to Tal Yarkoni and Dr Russ Poldrack, fromm the Image Research Centre, Ut Austin, for their
helpful suggestions and tips. We are especially grateful to  OluwaSanmi Koyejo, who patiently guided us for this entire project.
We cannot fail to mention the excellent TACC resources, without which it would have been impossible to run experiments at this scale.
Finally we would like to thank Prof Ghosh for teaching us many practical nuances in the course that helped immensely during the project.
