 \subsection{Single Label Prediction}
 We present the accuracies of the pairwise single label predictions using all our approaches in the heat maps below.

Our Naive Bayes model performs similarly to the results reported in ~\cite{yarkoni2011large}. The results are quite good given the assumptions and simplicity underlying the model, as well as the large dimensions of our data.
Terms like phonological, pain and visual have a very high accuracy. For logistic regression, we see that the model beats Naive Bayes in some cases. FOr instance
terms like phonological which had a high accuracy in Naive Bayes, show an even higher accuracy here, improving by $5-8\%$. But in a few cases, the accuracy also dips by a factor of $2-3\%$.

The Linear SVM shows atrend similar to the logistic regression, improving the accuracy for the high accuracy terms from Naive Bayes as well as logistic regression.
Overall the SVM has a slight edge over the logistic regression model. As was expected, the ensmeble is the clear winner, though
again, it does only slightly better than the SVM.
