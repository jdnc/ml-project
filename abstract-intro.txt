Over the past few decades neuroscientists have studied brain images from EEG/MEG, fMRI and other sources to identify associations between psychological tasks and activity in brain regions~\cite{PMSKBY12}.
Although these studies have led to large amounts of literature and several discoveries of cognitive functions associated with certain brain regions (or networks) the mapping between functions to brain regions and vice-versa still remains largely unclear. For the purposes of this project, we look at enhancing a new automated framework NeuroSynth~\cite{yarkoni2011large}  that combines text-mining and machine learning techniques to generate probabilistic mappings between cognitive and neural states. Starting from their Naive Bayes classifier, we apply more sophisticated binary classifiers to the problem and also consider multi-label predictions and transfer-learning(?).

\section{Introduction and Related work}
In this project, we build on the existing NeuroSynth framework~\footnote{\protect \url{neurosynth.org}}. While the NeuroSynth framework offers tools for several types of meta-analyses, we primarily address the problem of Reverse Inference.  This can be stated more precisely as: \emph{Given a signature of neural activity,  identify  the cognitive state(s) and functions that the activations correspond to} (see fig~\ref{fig:revinf}). The scientific community typically uses fMRI scans for reporting this neural activity. Reverse inference is an extremely challenging problem since multiple cognitive states could have very similar neural signatures~\cite{yarkoni2011large} but it is also of major interest to the neourimaging community at large.

Previous approaches have generally tackled the Reverse Inference problem by manually analyzing fMRI scans of subjects, collected from the laboratory. There are several limitations of such an approach - for instance, involving human subjects for fMRI scans is labor and cost intensive and the number of data samples that can be gained from such efforts is also very less. Moreover all the meta-analyses based on such data is carried on a very small-scale at individual research labs, and fails to take advantage of the vast knowledge embodied in the entire research community. 

NeuroSynth's (and therefore our) approach is unique - in that we tackle the Reverse Inference problem not by requiring actual fMRI scans, but rather by exploiting the relatively large repository of neuro-imaging publications using text-mining and machine learning techniques.  There are many motivations and benefits that lead to this. For one, while fMRI scans are very few, there has been a growing body of publications related to neuro-imaging, thus offering a much larger source of data. Further by using machine learning techniques the decoding is possible without any real training data (fMRI scans) and at the same time incorporates the knowledge base derived from several researcher. Also to the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that is fully automated, thus making it possible to perform several meta-analyses on a much larger scale than could ever be possible by individual researchers.  In the next few paragraphs, we introduce the NeuroSynth framework and some of the techniques it utilizes.
