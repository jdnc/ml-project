% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Over the past few decades neuroscientists have studied brain images from EEG/MEG, fMRI and other sources to identify associations between psychological tasks and activity in brain regions~\cite{PMSKBY12}.
Although these studies have led to large amounts of literature and several discoveries of cognitive functions associated with certain brain regions (or networks) the mapping between functions to brain regions and vice-versa still remains largely unclear. For the purposes of this project, we look at enhancing a new automated framework NeuroSynth~\cite{yarkoni2011large}  that combines text-mining and machine learning techniques to generate probabilistic mappings between cognitive and neural states. Starting from their Naive Bayes classifier, we apply more sophisticated binary classifiers to the problem and also consider multi-label predictions and transfer-learning(?).
