      "# Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "In this lab, we'll walk through some of the features of the Neurosynth core tools (http://github.com/neurosynth/neurosynth). By the end, you'll know how to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Import the modules you'll need to perform basic analyses\n",
      "* Create a new Neurosynth dataset object from provided text files\n",
      "* Run a simple term-based meta-analysis\n",
      "* Run a slightly more complicated term-based meta-analysis\n",
      "* Perform meta-analytic contrasts\n",
      "* Generate seed-based coactivation maps\n",
      "* \"Decode\" your own images\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "We're not going to cover installation here--sorry! See the quickstart guide in the [github repository](http://github.com/neurosynth/neurosynth) for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Running this code\n",
      "\n",
      "To run the examples below, you have several options:\n",
      "\n",
      "* *Run from within IPython Notebook*. This is the preferred approach if you have IPython Notebook installed. Put this file (neurosynth_demo.ipynb) in its own directory. Now launch the IPython dashboard from a command line prompt by typing \"ipython notebook\" (without quotes), then open the Neurosynth demo. You should now be able to run any cell in the notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "* *Run in IPython*. From a terminal prompt, launch IPython (just type ipython). Now paste the code blocks below.\n",
      "\n",
      "* *Write a standalone script*. Save the code blocks below to a separate file and run it as a Python script. This is not recommended as it's non-interactive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all cases, you'll need to make sure that the data files called below (database.txt and features.txt) are accessible at the locations indicated (a subfolder called data/).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Importing modules\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the basics. In Python, most modules (i.e., organized chunks of code) are inaccessible by default. Other than a few very basic built-in functions, you'll need to explicitly include every piece of code you want to work with. This may seem cumbersome, but it has the nice effect of (a) making sure you always know exactly what dependencies your code has, and (b) minimizing the memory footprint of your app by only including functionality you know you'll need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most Python packages, Neurosynth consists of several modules arranged into a semi-sensible tree structure. For this lab, we'll need functionality available in several modules, which we can include like so:"

      "\n",
      "Next, we create a Dataset, which is the core object most Neurosynth tools operate on. We initialize a Dataset by passing in a database file, which is essentially just a giant list of activation coordinates and associated study IDs. This file can be downloaded from the Neurosynth website or installed from the data submodule (see the Readme for instructions).\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating the object will take a few minutes on most machines, as we need to process about 200,000 activations drawn from nearly 6,000 studies. Once that's done, we also need to add some features to the Dataset. Features are just variables associated with the studies in our dataset; literally any dimension a study could be coded on can constitute a feature that Neurosynth can use. In practice, the default set of features included in the data download includes 500 psychological terms (e.g., 'language', 'emotion', 'memory', etc.) that occur with some frequency in the dataset. So when we're talking about the \"emotion\" feature, we're really talking about how frequently each study in the Dataset uses the word 'emotion' in the full-text of the corresponding article.\n",

It's important to note that the meta-analysis routines currently implemented in Neurosynth aren't very sophisticated; they're designed primarily for efficiency (most analyses should take just a few seconds), and take multiple shortcuts as compared to other packages like ALE or MKDA. But with that caveat in mind (and one that will hopefully be remedied in the near future), Neurosynth gives you a streamlined and quick way of running large-scale meta-analyses of fMRI data. Of course, all of the images you could generate using individual features are already available on the Neurosynth website, so there's probably not much point in doing this kind of thing yourself unless you've defined entirely new features.\n",

For example, let's say you want to meta-analytically contrast studies that use the term 'recollection' with studies that use the term 'recognition'. You can do this by defining both sets of studies separately, and then passing them both to the meta-analysis object:"

      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that meta-analytic contrasts generated using Neurosynth should be interpreted very cautiously. Remember that this is a meta-analytic contrast rather than a meta-analysis of contrasts. In the above example, we're comparing activation in all studies in which the term recognition shows up often to activation in all studies in which the term recollection shows up often (implicitly excluding studies that use both terms). We are NOT meta-analytically combining direct contrasts of recollection and recognition, which would be a much more sensible thing to do (but is something that can't be readily automated).\n",

We can do something very similar at a meta-analytic level (e.g., Toro et al, 2008, Robinson et al, 2010, Chang et al, 2012) using the Neurosynth data. Specifically, we can define a seed region and then ask what other regions tend to be reported in studies that report activity in our seed region. The Neurosynth tools make this very easy to do. We can either pass in a mask image defining our ROI, or pass in a list of coordinates to use as the centroid of spheres. In this example, we'll do the latter:"

      "\n",
      "One of the most useful features of Neurosynth is the ability to 'decode' arbitrary images by assessing their similarity to the reverse inference meta-analysis maps generated for different terms. For example, you might wonder whether a group-level z-score map for some experimental contrast is more consistent with recollection or with recognition. You could even use Neurosynth as a simple (but often effective) classifier by running a series of individual subjects through the decoder and picking the class (i.e., term) with the highest similarity. Perhaps the most powerful--though somewhat more computationally intensive--use is to do open-ended decoding. That is, we can take the entire set of features included in the base Neurosynth data download and rank-order them by similarity to each of our input images.\n",
      "\n",

We assess the similarity of each map with respect to 9 different terms and save the results to a file. Note that if we left the features argument unspecified, the decoder would default to using the entire set of 500+ features (which will take a few minutes on most machines unless you've pregenerated the feature maps--but that's for a different tutorial)."
