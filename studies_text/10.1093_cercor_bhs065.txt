Recent work has indicated that the insula may be involved in goal-
directed cognition, switching between networks, and the conscious
awareness of affect and somatosensation. However, these ﬁndings
have been limited by the insula’s remarkably high base rate of
activation and considerable functional heterogeneity. The present
study used a relatively unbiased data-driven approach combining
resting-state connectivity-based parcellation of the insula with
large-scale meta-analysis to understand how the insula is
anatomically organized based on functional connectivity patterns
as well as the consistency and speciﬁcity of
the associated
cognitive functions. Our ﬁndings support a tripartite subdivision of
the insula and reveal that the patterns of functional connectivity in
the resting-state analysis appear to be relatively conserved across
tasks in the meta-analytic coactivation analysis. The function of the
networks was meta-analytically ‘‘decoded’’ using the Neurosynth
framework and revealed that while the dorsoanterior insula is more
consistently involved in human cognition than ventroanterior and
posterior networks, each parcellated network is speciﬁcally
associated with a distinct function. Collectively, this work suggests
that the insula is instrumental in integrating disparate functional
systems involved in processing affect, sensory-motor processing,
and general cognition and is well suited to provide an interface
between feelings, cognition, and action.

Introduction
The insula is one of the most frequently activated regions in
functional neuroimaging research (Duncan and Owen 2000;
Nelson et al. 2010; Yarkoni et al. 2011). Insular activation is
reliably reported in a broad range of cognitive domains
(Augustine 1996; Shelley and Trimble 2004), yet a detailed
understanding of the functional anatomy of the insula is only
now beginning to emerge (Craig 2009; Singer et al. 2009).
Recent studies employing a diverse range of methodological
approaches—including cytoarchitectonic mapping (Mesulam
and Mufson 1982; Kurth, Eickhoff, et al. 2010), tractography
(Nanetti et al. 2009), meta-analysis of task-related functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (Wager and Feldman-
Barrett 2004; Mutschler et al. 2009; Kurth, Zilles, et al. 2010),
and functional connectivity (Nelson et al. 2010; Cauda et al.
2011; Deen et al. 2011)—appear to converge on the functional
parcellation of the insula into at least 3 functionally distinct
subregions. These include a ventroanterior region associated

with chemosensory (Pritchard et al. 1999) and socio-emotional
processing (Sanfey et al. 2003; Chang et al. 2011), a dorsoante-
rior
region associated with higher cognitive processing
(Dosenbach et al. 2006; Eckert et al. 2009), and a posterior
insula region associated with pain and sensorimotor processing
(Craig 2002; Wager et al. 2004).

Despite the emerging consensus, several important ques-
tions about the role of insula activation in cognition remain
unanswered. First, parcellation-based methods of resting-state
data are inherently limited in their ability to directly link
networks to speciﬁc functions due to the absence of any
cognitive manipulation. At least one study has proposed that
connectivity patterns in the insula may change according to the
function being probed (Jabbi et al. 2008). Moreover, most
studies have focused on one type of analysis (e.g., functional
connectivity, meta-analysis, etc.); it remains unclear to what
extent functional distinctions are consistent across different
kinds of data.

region is

Second, efforts to map distinct insula regions onto speciﬁc
cognitive functions have focused disproportionately on a few
psychological domains (Wager and Feldman-Barrett 2004;
Mutschler et al. 2009). But systematic functional--anatomical
mapping requires a comprehensive representation of psycho-
logical tasks and states in order to quantify both how consistent
and how speciﬁc activations of different insula regions are
(Wager et al. 2009). ‘‘Consistency’’ is necessary for determining
reliably associated with
whether a particular
a particular cognitive process (i.e.,
the degree to which
a cognitive function implies a particular brain activation),
while ‘‘speciﬁcity’’ is essential for performing reverse inference
(i.e., the degree to which a particular brain activation implies
a cognitive function) (Poldrack 2006). Establishing speciﬁcity is
particularly crucial because insula regions differ considerably in
activation likelihood. Whereas the dorsal anterior insula is
activated in virtually all tasks involving goal-directed cognition
(Duncan and Owen 2000; Dosenbach et al. 2006; Yarkoni et al.
2009), posterior and ventroanterior insula activations are
reported much less frequently. Failing to account for such
differences could lead to misattribution of the functional role
of different subregions.

The present study used a data-driven approach to insula
parcellation that combined functional connectivity analysis
with a new framework for meta-analysis that enables quanti-
ﬁcation of both the consistency and speciﬁcity of network
brain activity (Neurosynth; Yarkoni et al. 2011). We ﬁrst
parcellated the insula using a clustering analysis of functional
connectivity patterns in resting-state fMRI data and replicated

the tripartite division observed in previous studies. We then
identiﬁed broader networks that were functionally coactivated
with the insula regions both at rest and in over 4400 studies
and used the NeuroSynth framework to meta-analytically
‘‘decode’’ the functional role of these networks. Our results
corroborate previous functional divisions and importantly
extend these results by demonstrating a striking difference in
the speciﬁcity of activation across different insula regions.

Materials and Methods

Participants
Eighteen participants (mean age = 20.4, standard deviation = 2.6, female
= 56%) were recruited to participate in this study via advertisements
posted on the University of Arizona campus. All participants were
screened for signiﬁcant health-related or neuropsychiatric disorders
and none were currently taking psychoactive medication. One
participant was excluded from the analysis for technical reasons
(corrupted data). All participants gave informed consent according to
procedures approved by the University of Arizona’s Institutional
Review Board.

Data Acquisition
Data were collected at the conclusion of a social decision-making
experiment
(Chang and Sanfey 2009, 2011). Participants were
instructed to close their eyes and keep their head as still as possible
and encouraged to let their minds wander. Each scanning session
included a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo
structural scan (time repetition [TR] = 11 ms, time echo [TE] = 4 ms,
matrix = 256 3 256, slice thickness = 1 mm, gap = 0 mm). The
functional resting scan lasted 2 min and 24 s and acquired 72 volumes
using a 3-shot multiple echo planar imaging GRAPPA sequence that was
optimized to maximize signal
in regions associated with high
susceptibility artifact, such as orbitofrontal cortex and medial temporal
lobe (Stocker et al. 2006; Weiskopf et al. 2006) (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 25 ms,
matrix = 96 3 96, ﬁeld of view = 192 mm, slice thickness = 3.0 mm,
42 axial slices, voxel size 2 3 2 3 3).

Data Preprocessing
Functional imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using the FSL
Software package 4.1.4 (FMRIB, Oxford, UK). The ﬁrst 3 volumes of
each functional run were discarded to account for T1 equilibrium
effects. Images were corrected for slice scan time using an ascending
interleaved procedure. Head motion was corrected using MCFLIRT
using a 6-parameter rigid-body transformation. Images were spatially
smoothed using a 5-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. A
high-pass ﬁlter was used to cut off temporal periods longer than 100 s.
All
images were initially coregistered to the participant’s high-
resolution structural scan and were then coregistered to the Montreal
Neurological Institute 152 person 2-mm template using a 12-parameter
afﬁne transformation. Nine covariates and their temporal derivatives
(18 covariates total) were regressed out and the resulting residual
(with a mean of 10 000) was used in all subsequent analyses. The
covariates included 1) average global signal (Fox et al. 2009), 2) average
CSF activity in two 2-mm diameter spheres placed in the lateral
ventricles (–24, –44, 8 and 26, –44, 8) (Fox et al. 2005, 2009), 3) average
activity in two 7-mm diameter spheres placed in white matter in the
prefrontal cortex (24, 40, 4 and –24, 40, 4) (Fox et al. 2005, 2009), and
4--9) 6 estimated head movement parameters from MCFLIRT procedure
(Lund et al. 2005). The spheres were coregistered from stereotactic
space to subject
space before extracting mean activity. These
covariates remove ﬂuctuations unlikely to occur as a result of regional
correlations.

Functional Parcellation Analysis
We used a data-driven approach to parcellate the right insula into
distinct anatomical subregions based on shared connectivity proﬁles

with the rest of the brain. The right insula was selected because of its
more frequent association with emotions and interoception (Craig
2002; Singer et al. 2009). This approach shares conceptual similarity
with other studies that have used diffusion tensor imaging to examine
white matter connectivity (Johansen-Berg et al. 2004; Beckmann et al.
2009) and more recently with resting-state fMRI (Cauda et al. 2011;
Deen et al. 2011). First, we created a 2D matrix of time series cross-
correlations for every voxel in the insula (n = 1252 deﬁned by the
Harvard--Oxford cortical atlas) with every voxel in the rest of the brain
(see Fig. 2, panel A). To reduce the search space, we downsampled
voxels outside of the insula to 5 3 5 3 6 mm3 (approximately 13 000).
We then created a correlation matrix of voxels in the insula based on
the similarity of their connectivity proﬁle with voxels in the rest of the
brain for every participant (see Fig. 2, panel B upper matrix). We sorted
this matrix using an unsupervised clustering technique (see Fig. 2,
panel B lower matrix). This process involved applying a k-means
clustering algorithm to ﬁnd voxels in the insula that shared similar
connectivity proﬁles to voxels in the rest of the brain. We did not place
any spatial constraints on the algorithm, thus voxels were more likely to
be clustered together the greater their similarity in connectivity
proﬁles with the rest of the brain. We used the k-means algorithm
implemented in Matlab using the best solution from 100 replicates.
Because we did not have a strong a priori hypothesis about the possible
number of subregions other than the 3 distinct cytoarchitectonic
regions, we used an objective validity indicator (VI) to determine the
optimal number of clusters. The VI maximizes the ratio between the
average intercluster distance to the average intracluster distance.
Finally, to create group maps for the clusters, we coregistered the
individual subject maps to stereotactic space and summed the number
of subjects that loaded on each cluster for every voxel in the insula.
Thus, the group maps were determined by the number of subjects that
had a similar spatial clustering solution. We used an arbitrary cutoff of
n = 10 participants to threshold the map (other thresholds yielded
similar cluster centers).

Determining Optimal Number of Clusters Using the VI
The k-means algorithm attempts to ﬁnd cluster solutions that minimize
the Euclidean distance between each data point and the cluster center.
To select the number of extracted clusters, we ran the clustering
algorithm on the restricted set of k[2,10] and used a VI to empirically
select the optimal clustering solution. Our VI is similar to those
proposed by others (Ray and Turi 1999) and represents the average
intercluster to intracluster distance ratio across subjects. First, we
calculate the average within-cluster sum of squares (intra)

Identifying Parcellated Network Analysis
To identify the brain networks that connect with each of the insular
subregions identiﬁed by the cluster analysis, we utilized a multilevel
multiple regression approach. Importantly, this method ensures that
the networks were statistically independent from activity in the other
subregions and were spatially consistent across subjects. We ﬁrst
extracted the average time series for each of the 3 subregions classiﬁed
by the clustering algorithm in subject space and entered them into

a ﬁrst-level general linear model. We then summarized these results at
the group level using a mixed effect model with full Bayesian inference
(Woolrich et al. 2004). We employed whole brain cluster correction
using an initial cluster threshold of Z > 2.3 and a Family Wise Error
corrected threshold of P < 0.05 (Worsley et al. 1992).

Meta-Analytic Coactivation Analysis
If the subregions identiﬁed by the clustering analysis reﬂect meaningful
functional divisions, they should emerge not only in time course--based
analyses but also in large-scale analyses of entire studies (Toro et al.
2008; Smith et al. 2009). Previous meta-analysis studies that sought to
identify functional divisions within the insula have focused on
a relatively small number of psychological domains (e.g., different
sensory modalities, cognitive control, etc.; Wager and Feldman-Barrett
2004; Mutschler et al. 2009; Kurth, Zilles, et al. 2010); however, such
analyses are susceptible to bias since researchers understandably tend
to choose those domains for analysis that were already thought to be
related to insula functionality. To provide a more comprehensive and
unbiased window into coactivation of the insula with other regions, we
instead relied on the ‘‘Neurosynth’’ database (http://neurosynth.org),
which at present contains activation coordinates for nearly 4400 fMRI
studies that were selected without regard for the psychological process
under investigation. Collectively, these studies comprise over 145 000
reported activations, representing the largest extant database of fMRI
activations (The references for all the individual studies can be found
on the Neurosynth website (www.neurosynth.org). The website
provides multiple interfaces for identifying speciﬁc studies, including
1) listing all studies included in each term-based meta-analysis; 2) listing
all studies that report activation within 10 mm of a given coordinate;
and 3) a search interface displaying all studies that contain a speciﬁed
keyword or author name.).

To identify networks associated with the cluster centers from each
insular subregion across studies in the Neurosynth database (n = 4393),
we identiﬁed regions in which activations were coreported with
activations in each of the insula subregions. Each voxel in the binary
database was coded as a 1 if it fell within 10 mm of a focus reported in
the study (cf. Wager et al. 2009). Speciﬁcally, for each voxel in the brain
(n = 231 202), we conducted a multiple logistic regression, predicting
coactivation status (present or absent in each of the studies) from
binary indicators of activation in each of the insula cluster centers
(again, coding presence vs. absence in each study). Each map was
thresholded using cluster correction with an initial cutoff of z > 4.5 and
a corrected P < 0.05. We also quantiﬁed the spatial coherence of the
resting state and the meta-analytic coactivation networks by computing
the Pearson correlation between pairs of maps across all voxels (Smith
et al. 2009). It is important to note that all 4393 studies were used to
estimate the connectivity beta parameters—co-occurrences and
non-occurrences both provide important sources of information in
understanding coactivation.

Meta-Analytic Decoding of Network Function
An important beneﬁt of the Neurosynth framework is that it enables
quantitative inferences about the potential cognitive functions associ-
ated with distributed patterns of activation. The database contains
automatically generated meta-analysis maps for several
thousand
psychological terms and topics (Poldrack et al. 2011; Yarkoni et al.
2011); importantly, these meta-analysis maps can distinguish ‘‘forward
inference’’
from ‘‘reverse inference’’ (Poldrack 2006). Forward in-
ference reﬂects the probability of observing activity in a region given
knowledge of the psychological process; this is the type of inference
produced by most fMRI studies, which start from a known experimen-
tal manipulation and observe the pattern of brain activity associated
with that manipulation. In contrast, reverse inference reﬂects the
probability of a psychological process being present given knowledge
of activation in a particular brain region. Reverse inference is analogous
to ‘‘decoding’’ mental states from brain activity and is arguably what
researchers are interested in most of the time; however, it is rarely
possible to produce such inferences in individual fMRI studies, since
knowing the probability with which a given brain state implies a given
mental state implicitly requires knowledge of the probability with

which the same brain state implies many other mental states. Because
the Neurosynth framework contains a relatively comprehensive set of
term-to-activation mappings,
it is possible to compute whole-brain
maps for individual psychological concepts in both the forward
direction (i.e., P(ActivationjState)) and the reverse direction (i.e.,
P(StatejActivation)). Statistical
inference is then performed using
a chi-square test to generate P value maps, and the resulting maps
are FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons (for full details, see
Yarkoni et al. 2011). Thus, one can establish both how consistently
a particular task or state activates a given region and how speciﬁc
activation in that region is to the task—effectively decoding mental
states from brain activity.

In the present study, we used the Neurosynth database to meta-
analytically decode the functional role of distinct insula-based net-
works. For each meta-analytic insula coactivation map (see above), we
computed the voxel-wise Pearson correlation with each of 200 topic-
based meta-analysis maps in the Neurosynth database (see http://
neurosynth.org). The topics were generated by applying Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to the full text of all articles in the
Neurosynth database. LDA is a generative model for text (Blei et al.
2003) and assumes that each article is generated by sampling words
from a set of topic distributions. The distribution of words over topics
and topics over articles was inferred using Bayesian inference as
implemented by MALLET (McCallum 2002). Topic loadings were
computed for all articles and were used to identify articles with high
loadings on each topic (for full details, see Poldrack et al. 2011).
Contrast maps for each individual topic were created by comparing
studies that loaded highly on that topic with all other studies. Whole-
brain forward and reverse inference maps for each topic were
computed in an identical manner to that described previously for
term-based analyses in Yarkoni et al. (2009, 2011) (see also http://
neurosynth.org). We conducted separate correlation analyses for
forward inference and reverse inference topic maps. The resulting
coefﬁcients were then used to generate a ranking of the psychological
topics most consistently or speciﬁcally associated with each insula
network, where the consistency analysis indicated the extent to which
the insula network resembled the one activated by a particular task, and
the speciﬁcity analysis indicated the degree to which activation of the
insula network implied that a task or state was likely to be present.

Results

Functional Parcellation
While the optimal cluster solution ranged from a k of 2 to 5 for
individual subjects, the VI metric converged on a 3-cluster
solution for the group (see Fig. 1, panel C). The 3D cluster
solution for a representative subject can be seen in Figure 1,
panel D. As is evident
in this subject’s ordered insular
correlation matrix (Fig. 1, panel B), the clustering algorithm
was able to successfully group voxels together that shared
similar patterns of connectivity with the rest of the brain.
Importantly, the individual cluster solutions were associated
with a consistent spatial proﬁle across participants (Fig. 2).
Figure 2 depicts voxels that were classiﬁed similarly for at least
10 participants (approximately 70% of the sample). Our data-
driven approach ﬁnds 2 main subdivisions of the insula. The
ﬁrst subdivision is between voxels in the anterior and posterior
insula (–38, –10, 6). The anterior insula further parcellates into
dorsal (–38, 12, –2) and ventral (–34, 8, –8) subregions. These
results successfully replicate other parcellation studies, which
have found a 3-cluster solution (Deen et al. 2011).

Resting-State Network Connectivity
As described above,
the parcellation analysis identiﬁed 3
distinct insular subregions. Our connectivity analysis demon-
strates that these subregions were associated with distinct

functional networks. The ﬁrst network was associated with the
ventroanterior portion and was functionally connected to
primarily limbic areas including the amygdala, ventral tegmen-
tal area (VTA), superior temporal sulcus, and posterolateral
orbitofrontal cortex. The second network was functionally
connected to the dorsoanterior portion of the insula and
included the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The third network was functionally
connected to the posterior insula and included the supple-
mentary motor area (SMA) and somatosensory cortex. The 3
divisions of
the insula and their associated functionally
connected networks can be seen in Figure 3. These results
are similar to those reported by Deen et al. (2011) but are more
discriminated as a result of our multiple regression procedure.

Meta-Analytic Coactivation Networks
We were further interested in whether the networks we
observed in our resting-state data were task speciﬁc or could

also be found in studies that manipulated cognitive states. We
used the cluster centers identiﬁed in the parcellation analysis in
a multiple logistic regression in order to identify networks that
were independently coactivated across the 4400 studies in the
Neurosynth database. This meta-analytic coactivation analysis
(Robinson et al. 2010) identiﬁed similar networks found in the
resting-state functional connectivity analysis. The ventroante-
rior cluster was coupled primarily to limbic regions including
the bilateral amygdalae, ventral striatum, VTA, temporal poles,
LOFC, and MPFC. The dorsoanterior cluster was coupled to
bilateral DACC, DLPFC, dorsal striatum, and TPJ. Finally, the
posterior region was connected to the SMA, posterior temporal
lobes, somatosensory cortex, right hippocampus, and rostral
ACC. We observed a strong spatial coherence between the
resting-state parcellated networks and the meta-analytic
coactivation networks with moderate to strong overlap in all
3 cases (r = 0.36, 0.51, and r = 0.48 for ventroanterior,
respectively). The

that they were identiﬁed from very different levels of analysis.
These results suggest that network connectivity is highly
robust and relatively invariant to task.

Meta-Analytic Decoding of Network Function
Finally, we used the Neurosynth database to meta-analytically
decode the psychological processes associated with each
distinct insula network. To do this, we correlated each meta-
analytic insula coactivation network with the forward and
reverse inference meta-analysis maps for 200 distinct topics
(We ran all the analyses initially on a subset of the database
(~3000 studies) prior to the expansion of the database and
found virtually identical results, which suggests that these
ﬁndings are stable and will likely not dramatically change as
new studies are added to the database.). Table 1 illustrates the 5
unique topics (and accompanying terms) most associated with
each network that were present in both forward and reverse
inference analyses and did not describe either a methodological
technique or statistical analysis (e.g., BOLD, cluster, TMS, etc.).
The full table of correlation values for the forward and reverse
inference analyses for all 200 topics can be found on our
website (http://www.u.arizona.edu/~ljchang/NewSite/papers/
Changetal_InsulaTopicCorrelations.xls). The top 15 unique
topics implied by each network maps that were not about
methods can be seen in Figure 4.

dorsoanterior insula and functionally connected regions such
as the ACC tend to show substantially higher rates of activation
than other regions in neuroimaging studies (Duncan and Owen
2000; Nelson et al. 2010; Yarkoni et al. 2011), which has lead
some to conclude that the network is processing goal-directed
cognition (Dosenbach et al. 2006; Yarkoni et al. 2009).

However, correlating each meta-analytic insula coactivation
network with reverse inference meta-analysis maps—effectively
decoding mental states from brain activation—revealed clear
functional dissociations between insula networks (Fig. 5). The
ventroanterior insular network was associated with topics
related to emotion, chemosensation, and autonomic function;
the dorsoanterior insular network was associated with topics
related to higher cognitive tasks and executive control; and the
posterior insular network was associated primarily with pain,
sensorimotor, and language-related topics. Figure 5 displays the
relative speciﬁcity of activation of each insular network across
a number of relevant topics. These results extend previous
conceptualizations of the insula that have used region of interest
(ROI)-based meta-analyses (Wager and Feldman-Barrett 2004;
Mutschler et al. 2009; Kurth, Zilles, et al. 2010).

Discussion
While previous studies have begun to delineate the dissociable
functional roles of different insula regions, the present study is
the ﬁrst to combine time series--based analyses of the insula
with large-scale, data-driven meta-analysis of the extant neuro-
imaging literature. We demonstrated a marked convergence
across time series and meta-analytic approaches and provided
strong evidence for functional speciﬁcity in distinct insula
networks. Importantly, our analyses were performed on a large,
representative set of studies and terms, and thus provide
relatively unbiased estimates of the functional speciﬁcity and
consistency of activation in different
insula regions. Our
approach enabled us to not only functionally distinguish
different
to quantitatively
estimate the relative degree of functional speciﬁcity displayed
by each region.

regions within the insula but

Functional Dissociations within the Insula
Our ﬁndings converge with prior cytoarchitectonic studies
(Mesulam and Mufson 1982; Kurth, Zilles, et al. 2010), meta-
analyses (Wager and Feldman-Barrett 2004; Mutschler et al.
2009; Kurth, Zilles, et al. 2010) and functional connectivity
studies (Deen et al. 2011) in identifying 3 functionally distinct
regions within the human insula. The dorsal/ventral distinction
we observed in the anterior insula is consistent with that found
by Nelson et al. (2010), which used an edge detection
algorithm to ﬁnd functional borders in the anterior insula
based on patterns of resting-state connectivity. Our results
diverge slightly from another parcellation study, which
employed a very coarse resolution (only 10 insular ROIs
compared with our 1252) and a priori ﬁxed the number of
clusters to 2 (Cauda et al. 2011). However, in their hierarchical
clustering analysis, they also observed modest support for

a 3-cluster solution. Despite these technical differences, our
results appear to be highly consistent with extant literature and
suggest that the insula may be parcellated into at least 3
different regions.

The ventroanterior agranular insula appears to be involved in
the processing of chemosensory information such as olfaction
and gustation (Yaxley et al. 1990; Pritchard et al. 1999). In
contrast, the posterior granular insula seems to be a multimodal
convergence zone for sensory information and processes
exteroreceptive information (e.g., touch, temperature, and
pain),
interoceptive information (e.g., somatovisceral sensa-
tions) (Craig 2002, 2003), auditory information (Bamiou et al.
2003), and vestibular information (Guldin and Grusser 1998;
Brandt and Dieterich 1999).

The convergence of multimodal sensory information and
ability to readout subjective states (Craig 2009; Ullsperger et al.
2010) likely explains why the insula is intimately involved in
affective processing (Damasio et al. 2000; Wager and Feldman-
Barrett 2004). In particular, it has been associated with both
the experience and observation (Wicker et al. 2003) of disgust
to both taste and smell (Phillips et al. 1997), anticipatory
anxiety (Phelps et al. 2001; Berns et al. 2006), feelings of anger
(Damasio et al. 2000; Denson et al. 2009), guilt (Chang et al.
2011), and also moral violations (Sanfey et al. 2003). Affective
processing is functionally important
for detecting salient
information and signaling the recruitment of additional
attentional resources and cognitive control. Thus, the insula
is also well suited to interface between physiological sensations
and higher order cognitive systems and in accordance with this
conceptualization has routinely been implicated in a variety of
cognitive processes (Duncan and Owen 2000; Dosenbach et al.
2006; Eckert et al. 2009; Van Snellenberg and Wager 2009;
Yarkoni et al. 2009). In fact, the insula has been demonstrated
to be functionally connected with the anterior cingulate,

(Seeley et al. 2007) and appears to be integrally involved in
switching between the executive control and default networks
(Sridharan et al. 2008; Menon and Uddin 2010).

Our work addresses a number of limitations associated with
previous functional connectivity (Cauda et al. 2011; Deen et al.
2011) and meta-analyses (Wager and Feldman-Barrett 2004;
Mutschler et al. 2009; Kurth, Zilles, et al. 2010) studies. First,
due to the very nature of the type of data (i.e., no manipulation
of function), parcellation of resting-state connectivity patterns
cannot directly link networks to a speciﬁc function. It is
important to note this limitation because at least one previous
study has suggested that the insula’s connectivity patterns may
change as a function of the active cognitive state. For example,
while the anterior insula is involved in both experiencing and
imagining disgust, it appears to be differentially functionally
coupled to networks associated with somatosensory or
cognitive functions, respectively (Jabbi et al. 2008). Our results
provide evidence countering this argument as we replicated
the resting-state functional connectivity networks in our meta-
analytic coactivation analysis of nearly 4400 neuroimaging
studies. This suggests that rather than the insula changing

connectivity patterns based on cognitive state, it may be the
involvement of different insular subregions and
degree of
(relatively conserved)
that change
depending on the function being probed.

Distinguishing Consistency from Speciﬁcity
Although previous studies have identiﬁed functional dissocia-
tions between different insula regions, our approach allowed us
to expand on this work by separately quantifying both the
speciﬁcity and the consistency of insula activation for different
psychological processes. Forward inference analysis revealed
that the dorsoanterior insula network was more consistently
activated than the ventroanterior and posterior networks for
nearly all topics. This ﬁnding is in accord with recent work
demonstrating that the dorsoanterior insula and ACC tend to
show substantially higher rates of activation than other regions
in neuroimaging studies (Duncan and Owen 2000; Nelson et al.
2010; Yarkoni et al. 2011), which has lead some to conclude
that the network is nonspeciﬁcally involved in general goal-
directed cognition (Dosenbach et al. 2006; Yarkoni et al. 2009).
However, our reverse inference/decoding analysis revealed

functional speciﬁcity for all 3 insula
networks. The ventroanterior insular network was associated
with topics related to emotion, chemosensation, and auto-
nomic function;
insular network was
associated with topics related to higher cognitive tasks and
executive control; and the posterior insular network was
associated primarily with pain, sensorimotor, and language-
related topics.

the dorsoanterior

The fact that the dorsoanterior network is reliably activated
by a broad range of goal-directed tasks despite showing
considerable speciﬁcity in our decoding analysis suggests that
while the higher cognitive functions supported by this network
may be relatively circumscribed, those functions are probably
a prerequisite for many different
forms of goal-directed
cognition. Put differently, many different kinds of tasks—for
example, attending to sensory stimuli, viewing emotional

level
(Dosenbach et al. 2006; Nelson et al. 2010). But this does not
imply that the role of dorsoanterior insula is to attend to
sensory stimuli or process emotion. Thus, our ﬁndings un-
derscore the importance of distinguishing between consis-
tency and speciﬁcity of activation and provide additional
support
to extant hypothesis-driven and ROI-based meta-
analytic work (Wager and Feldman-Barrett 2004; Mutschler
et al. 2009; Kurth, Zilles, et al. 2010).

Limitations
While we believe our ﬁndings provide an important step in
using data-driven approaches to infer the functional neuro-
anatomy of the insula and identify likely associated cognitive
functions based on network connectivity, there are a number
of important caveats in interpreting these results (for extended
discussion, see Yarkoni et al. 2011). First, our automated
methods assume that frequently occurring terms in an article
will accurately reﬂect the cognitive processes reﬂected in brain
ﬁndings presented in the accompanying tables. At present, the
software does not take into account methodological details
that might
the ﬁndings (e.g., stereotactic space,
direction of contrast, type of paradigm, etc.). However, it is
important
these potential problems should
primarily result in random variation and thereby not reﬂect
any systematic bias. In other words, these potential short-
comings will only make it more difﬁcult to ﬁnd signiﬁcant
results and should not systemically inﬂuence the results it does
detect. In addition, random ﬂuctuations will theoretically be
minimized as the number of studies in the database increases in
size.

to note that

impact

Second, this approach is effective primarily for relatively
coarse cognitive processes that can be adequately captured by
broad terms (e.g., emotion); it currently has little ability to
capture more nuanced distinctions (e.g., disgust vs.
fear).
Despite this limitation, the automated Neurosynth software has
been highly successful at replicating ﬁndings using manually
coded methods and decoding broad cognitive states
in
individual human subjects (Yarkoni et al. 2011), and we are
currently working to improve speciﬁcity via alternative coding
and modeling approaches (e.g., Poldrack et al. 2011).

Finally,

the Neurosynth software cannot account

for
conﬁrmation bias present in the literature. For example, the
fact that people routinely associate amygdala activation with
emotion (and hence are more likely to publish this association)
will increase the likelihood that the software will determine
that amygdala activity implies an emotional state. This is an
important limitation, as it presently constrains the promise of
a fully automated and completely unbiased analytical approach.
However, this problem is also present in every other method
not excluding our own inherent assessments. The beneﬁt of
our approach is that it minimizes the potential of introducing
further biases at various stages of analysis.

Conclusions
Combining resting-state connectivity—based parcellation of
the insula with large-scale meta-analysis, this study applied
a relatively unbiased data-driven approach to understand how
the insula is anatomically organized based on functional
connectivity patterns and the consistency and speciﬁcity of

associated cognitive functions. Our ﬁndings support a tripartite
subdivision of the insula, with dorsoanterior, ventroanterior,
and posterior
regions broadly mapping onto cognitive,
affective-chemosensory, and sensorimotor processing, respec-
tively. We also ﬁnd evidence that different
tasks elicit
differential engagement of relatively conserved insula networks
rather than altering large-scale connectivity patterns with
insula subregions. Finally, we ﬁnd that while the dorsoanterior
insula is more consistently involved in human cognition than
ventroanterior and posterior networks, each parcellated
network is speciﬁcally associated with a distinct function.
Collectively, this work suggests that the insula is instrumental
in integrating disparate functional systems involved in process-
ing affect, sensory-motor processing, and general cognition and
is well suited to provide an interface between feelings,
cognition, and action.
