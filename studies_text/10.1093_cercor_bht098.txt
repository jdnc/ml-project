The human inferior parietal cortex convexity (IPCC) is an important
association area, which integrates auditory, visual, and somatosen-
sory information. However, the structural organization of the IPCC is
a controversial issue. For example, cytoarchitectonic parcellations
reported in the literature range from 2 to 7 areas. Moreover, anatom-
ical descriptions of the human IPCC are often based on experiments
in the macaque monkey. In this study, we used diffusion-weighted
magnetic resonance imaging combined with probabilistic tractogra-
phy to quantify the connectivity of the human IPCC, and used this
information to parcellate this cortex area. This provides a new struc-
tural map of the human IPCC, comprising 3 subareas (inferior parie-
tal cortex anterior, IPC middle, and IPC posterior) of comparable
size,
in a rostro-caudal arrangement in the left and right hemi-
spheres. Each subarea is characterized by a connectivity ﬁngerprint,
and the parcellation is similar to the subdivision reported for the
macaque IPCC with 3 areas in a rostro-caudal arrangement (PF, PFG,
and PG). However, the present study also reliably demonstrates new
structural features in the connectivity pattern of the human IPCC,
which are not known to exist in the macaque. This study quantiﬁes
intersubject variability by providing a population representation of
the subarea arrangement and demonstrates the substantial laterali-
zation of the connectivity patterns of the IPCC.

Introduction
The human inferior parietal cortex convexity (IPCC) is an
important association area, which integrates auditory, visual,
and somatosensory information. This region plays a prominent
role in visuo-spatial attention, especially in the right hemi-
sphere, and in particular in the stimulus-driven ventral fronto-
parietal attention network. In contrast, the superior posterior
parietal lobe (SPL) is (bilaterally) engaged in the more endogen-
ously driven dorsal attention network (Corbetta and Shulman
2002). A second important area of involvement for the IPCC is
in episodic memory retrieval. Paralleling the dichotomy of their
involvement in the attention networks, the SPL is more associ-
ated with endogenous or voluntary processes, while the IPCC
supports processes like recollection, driven by external events
(Cabeza et al. 2008; Vilberg and Rugg 2008). Moreover, in the
left hemisphere, the IPCC is an important constituent of the cor-
tical language network (Sakai et al. 2001; Binder et al. 2009;
Graves et al. 2010; Hartwigsen et al. 2010; Price 2010).

There is evidence that the IPCC can be further subdivided

episodic memory effects are primarily found in the rostral
part of IPCC (approximately the supramarginal gyrus; Cabeza
et al. 2008; Vilberg and Rugg 2008). This same rostral area is
related to covert articulation and phonological decision/
mapping within the language network, while the caudal part
of IPCC (approximately the angular gyrus) is involved in se-
mantic retrieval (Vigneau et al. 2006; Binder et al. 2009;
Graves et al. 2010; Price 2010).

Hence, the IPCC accommodates a rich variety of cognitive
functionality, which maps onto distinct functionally special-
ized subareas. This is likely to be paralleled by a similar struc-
tural organization of anatomically distinct subareas. However,
this subdivision remains a controversial
issue. Brodmann
(1909), in his “classical” cytoarchitectonic map, subdivided
the IPCC into 2 regions: Rostral area 40 (on the supramarginal
gyrus) and caudal area 39 (on the angular gyrus). Subsequent
investigators, using cytoarchitecture (von Economo and Kos-
kinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkissov et al. 1955) or mye-
loarchitecture (Vogt 1911; Batsch 1956), parcellated the IPCC
into a higher number of regions, each characterized by a
speciﬁc regional architectonic layout (termed “subareas” or
“subregions”). A recent study (Caspers et al. 2006), using
state-of-the-art
cytoarchitectonic
mapping (Schleicher et al. 1999), found 7 areas in the IPCC: 5
in its rostral part (broadly equivalent to Brodmann area 40)
and 2 in its caudal part (broadly equivalent to Brodmann area
39). Subsequently, Caspers et al.
(2013) used receptor
mapping and showed that these 7 areas could be clustered
into 3 larger rostro-caudally arranged regions.

observer-independent

In the macaque monkey, the situation is more straightfor-
ward. The classical cyto- and myeloarchitectonic literature
identiﬁed 1 (Brodmann 1909) or 2 (Vogt and Vogt 1919; von
Bonin and Bailey 1947) regions. Multimodal studies employ-
ing architectonic mapping (Pandya and Seltzer 1982; Gregor-
iou et al. 2006), in vitro autoradiography of the distribution of
neurotransmitter binding sites (Geyer et al. 2005), tract tracing
(Pandya and Seltzer 1982; Rozzi et al. 2006), and electrophysi-
ology (Rozzi et al. 2008) converge on a parcellation into 4
regions: PF, PFG, PG, and Opt— aligned in a rostro-caudal ar-
rangement along the longitudinal axis of the IPCC. The no-
menclature of the areas were proposed by Pandya and Seltzer
(1982), based on the initial naming convention by von Bonin
and Bailey (1947). The 4 areas markedly differ in their archi-
tectonic organization (cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture,
regional distribution of neurotransmitter binding sites, and
immunoreactivity; Geyer et al. 2005; Gregoriou et al. 2006),
frontal, parietal, as well as temporal cortical connections
(Rozzi et al. 2006), and in the somatosensory, visual, as well
as motor responses of their neurons (Rozzi et al. 2008).

However, despite this extensive characterization, their poss-
ible homologs in humans are still unclear.

In humans, a different perspective may shed new light on this
old problem: Not only cyto- or myeloarchitecture, but also con-
nectivity patterns can structurally (and therefore, also function-
ally) characterize cortical areas. Diffusion-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging (dMRI), combined with probabilistic tracto-
graphy, elegantly measures such connectivity patterns noninva-
sively in living participants
(Johansen-Berg et al. 2004;
Anwander et al. 2007). This technique can be used to compute
connectivity ﬁngerprints that characterize the connectivity of a
brain area under investigation with a collection of preselected
target areas. For example, Behrens et al. (2003) parcellated the
human thalamus, according to its connectivity to a number of
macroanatomically deﬁned cortical regions. More recently, Rush-
worth et al. (2006) used probabilistic tractography to character-
ize the connectivity proﬁle of 6 predeﬁned target regions in the
lateral parietal cortex with 3 predeﬁned regions elsewhere in the
brain (superior colliculus, parahippocampal gyrus, and ventral
premotor cortex), which are known to project differentially to 3
distinct regions in macaque parietal cortex. They provide a de-
tailed comparison of the connection pathways between these
areas to corresponding pathways in the macaque brain.

A different, less hypothesis driven, approach exploits the fact
that probabilistic tractography is able to estimate the connec-
tivity proﬁle of each point in a region of interest (ROI; here the
IPCC) to the rest of the brain. With an automatic clustering
algorithm, cortical regions can then be identiﬁed, which feature
internally coherent but mutually distinct connectivity (Anwan-
der et al. 2007). This approach has been successfully applied to
parcellate the medial premotor cortex into supplementary and
presupplementary motor areas (Johansen-Berg et al. 2004), the
lateral premotor cortex into its dorsal and ventral subregions
(Tomassini et al. 2007; Schubotz et al. 2010), Broca’s area into
Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45 (Anwander et al. 2007; Klein
et al. 2007), and the cingulate cortex into anterior, midcingu-
late, and posterior subregions (Beckmann et al. 2009). Very
recently, Mars et al. (2011) investigated the right parietal cortex,
including the IPCC, using mixed anatomical criteria: Areas had
to be both compact and similarly connected as measured with
diffusion MRI. An ROI that included the anterior parts of the
occipital lobe and the parietal operculum was subdivided into 5
areas, arranged along the rostral–caudal axis. Additionally, they
investigated functional connectivity from parietal cortex to
some frontal and medio-temporal target areas using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting-state activity in
both macaque monkeys and humans.

If human and macaque IPCC are indeed homologous brain
regions, their long-range connectivity (The term “long-rang
connectivity” here refers to ﬁber connections that run through
the white matter, as opposed to “short-range” intracortical
connections.) patterns should be similar. This has been de-
monstrated recently by Caspers et al. (2011), who compared
tract-tracing results from macaques with probabilistic tracto-
grams of cytoarchitectonically predeﬁned areas in humans.

Here, in contrast to the work of Caspers et al. (2011), we
used dMRI probabilistic tractography, not only to characterize
the connectivity proﬁles of IPCC subareas, but also to deﬁne
these subareas in the ﬁrst place. In extension to the work of
Mars et al. (2011), we aimed at studying interhemispherical
differences and similarities in IPCC structural organization in
the light of the known strong functional lateralization (see

2 Tractography-Based Parcellation of the IPC • Ruschel et al.

above), at directly comparing the anatomical parcellation and
connectivity of IPCC with the connectional architecture of
macaque IPCC (based on classical tract tracing), and at asses-
sing the interindividual variance of the parcellation results
and the associated connectivity patterns. The results will help
to resolve the question of whether or not there is a ﬁne-
grained homology between human and macaque IPCC.

Materials and Methods

Participants
Twenty right-handed volunteers (10 males and 10 females, age
25.5 ± 3.5 years) participated in the study. All participants gave
written informed consent before being included in the experiment.
The participants had no history of neurologic, psychiatric, or other
major medical disorders and did not take any medication at the time
of data acquisition. The experimental set-up was approved by the
local ethics committee of the University of Leipzig, Germany. Data
were handled anonymously.

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
We acquired diffusion-weighted and high-resolution 3-dimensional (3D)
T1-weighted images on a Siemens 3-T Trio scanner with an 8-channel
array head coil and maximum gradient strength of 40 mT/m. For the
dMRIs, we employed a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence (rep-
etition time, TR = 12 s, echo time, TE = 100 ms, 72 axial slices, resolution
1.7 × 1.7 × 1.7 mm, no cardiac gating, 60 diffusion directions evenly dis-
tributed over the hemisphere, b-value = 1000 s/mm2). In addition, we
acquired 7 data sets with no diffusion weighting, ﬁrst at the beginning
and then after each block of 10 diffusion-weighted images, to serve as
anatomical
reference for motion correction. To increase the
signal-to-noise ratio, we repeated the measurement 3 times, resulting
in a total scan time of approximately 45 min. For the high-resolution
T1-weighted images, we employed a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid
acquisition with gradient echo sequence (TR = 1300 ms,
time to
inversion = 650 ms, TE = 3.97 ms, ﬂip angle 10°, 176 sagittal slices, res-
olution 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm, 2 repetitions, total scan time 12 min).

We reoriented the T1-weighted images to the sagittal plane through
the anterior and posterior commissures and used the images without
diffusion weighting to estimate motion correction parameters using
rigid-body transformations (Jenkinson et al. 2002), implemented in
FSL (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl; FMRIB Software Library, Univer-
sity of Oxford). We combined the motion correction for dMRI data
with global registration to the T1 anatomy, corrected the gradient di-
rections of each volume with the rotation parameters, interpolated the
registered images to an isotropic voxel resolution of 1 mm, and aver-
aged each subject’s 3 acquisitions. Finally, we computed the diffusion
tensor, the 3 eigenvectors, and the fractional anisotropy (FA) value
for each voxel (Basser et al. 1994). The FA image was used to create a
mask for the tractography, including brain white matter and neigh-
boring gray matter (threshold: FA >0.08). By rigid mapping of the dif-
fusion images and the gradient directions to the standardized
anatomical space, we were able to perform tractography in a common
anatomical space. The rigid registration of all dMRIs to the slightly
rotated T1 space introduces the same amount of smoothing (caused
by the interpolation) to all dMRIs. This reduces a potential directional
bias, which might be caused by a varying amount of interpolation for
the different dMRIs in the motion correction procedure. Additionally,
the registration to the T1 space circumvented additional alignment
steps after the preprocessing, without altering the tractography results
compared with a tracking procedure in the native diffusion space.
This was conﬁrmed by computing the cross-correlation between the
tractograms computed in the 2 different spaces, quantiﬁed by a high
correlation value (mean correlation in a single ROI = 0.85, SD 0.02).

Deﬁnition of the Region of Interest
Initially, the ROIs for tractography and parcellation were manually
deﬁned simultaneously on the pial and inﬂated white matter surfaces
(Fischl et al. 1999) as generated by FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.

Since we focused our analysis on the convexity of the inferior parietal
cortex, we excluded areas lying in the depth of the intraparietal sulcus
(IPS), postcentral sulcus, and parietal operculum. Hence, we chose
macroanatomical landmarks on or close to the exposed cortical surface
as borders of the ROI: The lateral lip of the IPS (1 in Fig. 1A), the caudal
lip of the postcentral sulcus (2 in Fig. 1A), the dorsal lip of the lateral
ﬁssure (3 in Fig. 1A), and the caudal shoulder of the angular gyrus (4 in
Fig. 1A). The neighboring 2 cytoarchitonically and functional different
areas called the human intraparietal area 1 and the human intraparietal
area 2, in the IPS (Choi et al. 2006), which extend up to the shoulder of
the sulcus were assured not to be part of the ROI. For the correct identi-
ﬁcation of the sulci, we used the “Atlas of the Cerebral Sulci” (Ono et al.
1990) to analyze the sulcal variability.

As a second step, we transformed the deﬁned surface labels into
the voxel space and used them as template to interactively mark all
voxels within this ROI that are located at the gray-white matter inter-
face (derived from the coregistered FA images with FA > 0.15) using
the software Anatomist (http://anatomist.info, Service Hospitalier Fré-
déric Joliot, CEA, Orsay, France) (1 in Fig. 1B). These voxels were
used as seed points for subsequent diffusion tractography (2 in
Fig. 1B). Voxels in the fundus of the bordering sulci were excluded to
prevent connections with deep white matter structures in the parietal
lobe like the long segment of the arcuate fascicle (Catani et al. 2005).

Tractography and Connectivity-Based Parcellation
We used the probabilistic tractography method and the connectivity-
based parcellation scheme similar to the one proposed by Anwander
et al. (2007). The underlying concept of connectivity-based parcellation
is that cortical areas with similar anatomical connectivity are combined
into a region, which is segregated from neighboring regions with differ-
ent connectivities. The connectivity pattern of a cortical voxel
is
approximated by the tractogram associated with its immediately under-
lying white matter voxel. Figure 1B illustrates the general principle of
the parcellation technique. For each seed voxel within the ROI (1 in
Fig. 1B), we computed a probabilistic tractogram (2 in Fig. 1B) and ar-
ranged the correlation values between any 2 of these tractograms in a
connectivity correlation matrix. In contrast to Anwander et al. (2007),
who used a k-means clustering approach in order to deﬁne the groups

of voxels with similar connectivity (3 in Fig. 1B), we applied a cluster
algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (as implemented in
MatLab™) to the columns of the connectivity correlation matrix. This
technique is better suited to cope with clusters, showing differences in
intracluster homogeneity (Gorbach et al. 2011).

A challenge for any clustering method is the trade-off between
model consistency (how well does the clustering describe the struc-
ture of the data) and model complexity (preference of a simple model
that describes the relevant features and ignores noise). Here, the clus-
ters had to be deﬁned a priori. We tested the different numbers of
clusters (2 ≤ n ≤ 7), but accepted only those solutions that were con-
sistent across hemispheres and participants, that is, the principal ar-
rangement of cortical areas (e.g., from inferior to superior or from
anterior to posterior) associated with the clusters had to be the same.
As a second requirement, each area had to represent a single topolo-
gically compact region of the cortex. Additionally, we characterized
each area by its tractographic signature (i.e. its average tractogram).
As a ﬁnal step, we mapped the resulting clusters back onto the corti-
cal surface of each individual brain (4 in Fig. 1B). The fact that this
clustering approach yields neuroanatomically meaningful results has
been substantiated in recent publications (Johansen-Berg et al. 2005;
Anwander et al. 2007; Beckmann et al. 2009; Schubotz et al. 2010).

For interpretation of the parcellation results, we ﬁrst assessed the
positions (computed as center-of-mass, in Talairach coordinates) and
sizes (by voxel counting) of all IPCC subareas in all participants and
hemispheres. We computed the mean and standard deviation (SD) of
these values for all participants.

To assess each area’s topographical variability, we computed for
each cluster a population overlap map. Therefore, we dilated the clus-
ters (voxels at the gray-white matter interface) by 3 mm orthogonally
to the surface and normalized all individual brains and clusters to the
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) single-subject brain (known as
“colin27”), superimposed them in 3D space, and computed the popu-
lation maps (Fig. 5). This map shows, for each cluster and each voxel
in MNI space, how many brains (0 ≤ n ≤ 20) have a representation of
this cluster in the particular voxel.

We qualitatively assessed the global connectivity proﬁle of each IPCC
subarea by mapping the values of its tractographic signature. The

Cerebral Cortex 3

seed regions for the tractography were derived from the population
map with a minimum overlap of 5 participants. Seed voxels within
overlapping areas were assigned to the subarea with the maximum
probability value. For tractography, the seed regions were morphed
to the single-subject brains. The connectivity was computed using a
total of 100 000 random walks (cf. Anwander et al. 2007) per seed
region. The single-subject connectivity patterns were normalized to
the MNI brain and averaged over all participants. The average connec-
tivity values in the gray-white matter interface were visualized on an
inﬂated cortex representation of the MNI brain (Fig. 6). To quantitat-
ively compare the connectivity patterns between the subareas, and
thereby establish signiﬁcant differences between these areas in terms
of
long-range connectivity, we analyzed each area’s connectivity
strength with speciﬁc target regions for all participants separately. For
this purpose, we interactively deﬁned 10 gyrus-based target ROIs (on
the average brain over 20 participants; see Fig. 2).

These target ROIs were deﬁned by macroanatomical landmarks
(sulci) on the inﬂated brain surface by manual reﬁnement of the auto-
matic gyrus labeling computed by FreeSurfer (Martinos Center for
Biomedical Imaging). The labeled cortical regions were mapped onto
the brain volume and warped by nonlinear registration of the mean
brain to the individual T1 anatomy of the 20 participants. The correct
warping of the target regions were manually validated in every indi-
vidual subject. Analog to the seed ROI deﬁnition, we labeled all
voxels at the gray-white matter interface within each region as target
voxels. On a single participant basis (and separately for each hemi-
sphere), we computed how many of the random walks starting in
each IPCC subarea reached each target. For statistical analysis of these
connectivity values, which cannot assumed to follow a normal distri-
bution, we used the nonparametric Friedman repeated-measures
analysis of variance model (factor 1: IPCC area, factor 2: target; each
hemisphere treated separately) and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for
post hoc pairwise comparisons between the levels of factor 1 (i.e.,
IPCC areas). All P-values were Bonferroni corrected for multiple com-
parisons. For testing connectivity differences between the hemi-
spheres, the same procedure was used.

Results
We varied the number of clusters between 2 and 7 and found
3 to be the maximum number, for which the clusters were
compact with a consistent principal spatial arrangement across

participants (see Materials and Methods). More speciﬁcally, in
37 of the 40 tested hemispheres, we found 3 compact, and
approximately equal-sized regions, in a roughly rostral–caudal
arrangement, referred to as inferior parietal cortex anterior
(IPCa), IPC middle (IPCm), and IPC posterior (IPCp; Fig. 3).
Figure 3 also shows the morphometric characterization of the
areas in 4 typical participants (for all participants, see Sup-
plementary Fig. 1a,b in the Supplementary data).

The variability and reproducibility of the parcellation results
of all participants are represented by the centers of mass of
subareas (Fig. 4). From Figure 4, one can see that IPCa mainly
coincides with the supramarginal gyrus (roughly BA 40),
while IPCp maps onto the angular gyrus (BA 39). Area IPCm
is located in the transition area between the 2 gyri. The IPCCs
of the left and right hemispheres (as well as the corresponding
subareas) were found to have similar sizes (Fig. 4). Comparing
the sizes of the subareas across hemispheres, we found similar
sized IPCm and IPCp and a slightly bigger IPCa. The size of
the subareas was measured by counting the number of bound-
ary voxels at the gray-white matter interface. This number was
converted into cm2 representing the size of each areas folded
surface. The centers of mass of the subareas show a consistent
rostro-caudal arrangement across participants. In the right
hemisphere, the regions are located slightly more anteriorly.
The variability of the spatial location across participants is
comparable for all subareas (see SDs in Fig. 4).

Figure 5 shows the population maps, illustrating that the
variability of the computed IPCC subareas over participants
displayed on the single-subject MNI standard brain. The
strong overlap of the population map across subjects shows
the consistency of the subdivision into 3 areas. The agreement
was best for the IPCa area. Left and right hemispheres show
similar results. The full 3D population maps in the MNI space
of all IPCC areas are publicly available (http://openscience.
cbs.mpg.de/ipcc) and additionally provided in Supplementary
data (Supplementary ﬁle 3), which can be used with func-
tional imaging software packages, such as FSLView or SPM.

pial surface; cs, central sulcus; lf, lateral ﬁssure.

Figure 6 shows, for each IPCC subarea, the group average
of the connectivity, as quantiﬁed by the tractographic signa-
ture value in the gray-white matter interface. This represen-
tation provides a high-resolution overview on the connectivity
proﬁles of the areas. The connectivity patterns show a strong
overlap between areas, but there are also some substantial
differences. For example, connections to the ventral premotor
cortex are stronger for anterior when compared with posterior
regions, and connections to the temporal lobe are stronger in
the left hemisphere than that in the right. This illustration of
the mean tractogram on the inﬂated brain surface (Fig. 6)
allows a precise localization of areas connected to the IPCC.
Beside local connections to the neighboring parietal and tem-
poral areas, all IPCC areas show a long-range connection to

the precentral gyrus (PrCG) via the superior longitudinal fas-
cicle (SLF). Additionally, a ventral connection to the anterior
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) via the extreme capsule ﬁber
bundle was found for the left IPCp. A slice view of the ﬁber
bundle showing the precise location of
the connections
within the white matter is provided in Supplementary data
(Supplementary Fig. 2).

The connection strengths between the IPCC subareas and
the cortical target regions are depicted in Figure 7A. Table 1
summarizes the results of the statistical tests. The strongest
connections of the areas IPCa, IPCm, and IPCp were found to
the lateral temporal cortex (superior temporal gyrus, STG;
middle temporal gyrus, MTG; and inferior temporal gyrus,
ITG), the SPL, the pre- and postcentral gyri (PrCG and PoCG),

and the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (IFG and middle
frontal gyrus, MFG; only in the right hemisphere). Connec-
tions with the occipital cortex, the dorso-lateral prefrontal
cortex (in both hemispheres), and the ventro-lateral prefrontal
cortex (in the left hemisphere) are weaker. There is a signiﬁ-
cant rostro-caudal (i.e., IPCa-to-IPCp) decrease in connectivity
strength to the superior temporal and inferior frontal cortex
in the right hemisphere. Moreover, we identiﬁed a similar
rostral–caudal decrease in connectivity to the superior tem-
poral cortex, and an increase in connectivity to the superior
parietal cortex in the left hemisphere (Fig. 7A).

In the left hemisphere, we found strong connections to
both the lateral temporal cortex and the superior parietal
cortex and weaker connections to both the occipital cortex
and the lateral frontal cortex. The right hemisphere shows
strongest connections to the lateral temporal cortex, superior
parietal cortex, and lateral frontal cortex. Only sparse connec-
tivity exists to the occipital cortex. Additionally, both hemi-
spheres show relatively strong connectivity to the pre- and
postcentral gyri.

To test for signiﬁcance, we performed a 2-way repeated-
measures Friedmann analysis of variance on ranks (factor 1:
IPC region and factor 2: target region), followed by a Wilcox-
on signed-rank test for post hoc pairwise comparisons. The
test results show signiﬁcant differences between IPCa, IPCm,
and IPCp in their connectivity strength to both the superior
temporal cortex and superior parietal cortex. In the right
hemisphere, signiﬁcant differences were also found in the
connection strength to the superior temporal cortex and fur-
thermore to the inferior frontal cortex (Fig. 7A and Table 1).

Figure 7B shows the comparison between the connectivity
patterns of the corresponding areas in the 2 hemispheres. In

IPCa, the left area has more connections to the MTG, while
the right area connects stronger to the STG, SFG, and IFG. For
the middle area IPCm, the right side has stronger connections
to the SFG and IFG. Finally, IPCp shows a stronger right-side
connectivity for the PrCG.

Discussion
In this study, we show that the human IPCC can be divided
into 3 subareas, arranged in a rostral–caudal direction, with
distinct connectivity patterns to the rest of the brain. In
addition, the principal topological arrangement and the con-
nectivity patterns of these subareas are relatively consistent
across participants. The variability between subjects is com-
parable for all regions and both hemispheres (Fig. 4). More-
over, the connectivity patterns are in principal agreement
with previous dMRI-based studies of the parietal lobe. For
example, connections between rostral IPCC and IFG, as well
as ventral premotor and somatosensory areas, have been de-
monstrated by Rushworth et al. (2006), Mars et al. (2011), and
Caspers et al. (2011). While we consistently found for all sub-
areas strongest connections to the lateral
temporal and
superior parietal cortices, there were also striking differences
between subareas: A rostral–caudal decrease in connection
strength to the inferior frontal (only for the right hemisphere)
and superior temporal regions (both hemispheres), and a
rostral–caudal increase in connection strength to the superior
parietal cortex (only for the left hemisphere). Note that it
could be argued that the rostral–caudal decreases in connec-
tivity are due to the distance bias associated with probabilistic
tractography (Jones 2010). However, as can be seen in
Figure 7A,B, the decrease in IFG connectivity from IPCa to

lf, lateral ﬁssure. Voxels that belong to the respective area in <5 participants are not shown.

IPCp amounts to about a factor between 3 and 5. The upper
bound of the distance bias (if ﬁbers spread completely uni-
formly into all directions) in probabilistic tractography is pro-
portional to the square of the distance. If the diffusion is
constrained by coherent structure, this exponent is much lower.
Simulations show that it is in the order of 1, which has been
used, for example, by Greenberg et al. (2012) and Anwander
et al. (2007). As the distance from IFG to IPCp is less than twice
the one from IFG to IPCa (Fig. 8), the difference in connection
strength cannot be purely an effect of distance bias.

What is the Most Appropriate Subdivision of the IPCC?
As with other cortical areas, the exact subdivision of human
IPCC has been a matter of debate. For example, Brodmann
(1909), on the basis of postmortem cytoarchitectonics, postu-
lated a subdivision into 2 areas, while later researchers, even
when using the same principal methodology, concluded that
there should be a higher number of subareas (von Economo
and Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkissov et al. 1955;
Caspers et al. 2006). Recently Caspers et al. (2013) used re-
ceptor mapping to suggest that the 7 cytoarchitectonically
deﬁned IPCC subareas (Caspers et al. 2006) can be clustered
into 3 larger rostro-caudally arranged regions. Moreover,

using postmortem myeloarchitecture as a structural criterion
leads to more than 2 subareas of IPCC (Vogt 1911; Batsch
1956).

The rostral–caudal arrangement found in this study is in
agreement with a number of previous studies using cytoarchi-
tecture (e.g., von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Sarkissov
et al. 1955; Caspers et al. 2006) and dMRI connectivity (Mars
et al. 2011). Concerning the number of distinguishable areas,
however, there are differences. Mars et al. (2011) subdivided,
at least, the right IPCC into 5 rostro-caudally arranged areas,
consistently over several participants. Here, we must consider
2 facts. First, these authors used a large ROI that included
both the parietal operculum (indeed, 1 of the 5 clusters was
mainly located there) and anterior parts of the occipital lobe.
Secondly, Mars and colleagues did not only rely on anatomical
connectivity for parcellation, but additionally asked for
compact clusters. This additional assumption might have
stabilized the parcellation and allowed for a higher number of
subareas to be consistent across participants. Caspers et al.
(2006) found 7 cytoarchitectonically deﬁned rostro-caudally
arranged areas altogether. However, they also acknowledge
that neighboring areas tend to be similar and can be com-
bined (cytoarchitectonic gradient).

Figure 6. Group-averaged connectivity of the IPCC subareas displayed on an inﬂated MNI brain. The white areas characterize the average seed areas and are derived from the
population maps (Fig. 5) with a minimum of 5 participants (no overlap between seed regions).

So, it seems that the anatomical similarity structure of the
cortex across studies in the ﬁeld does not converge to a clear
distinction into a ﬁxed number of homogeneous and clearly
distinguishable areas. Instead, it appears that the number,
location, and precise boundaries of areas are a matter of:
(1) The structural traits used as parcellation criteria (e.g., cy-
toarchitecture or long-range connectivity) and the sensitivity
of the methodology to extract them, and (2) the level of detail
considered relevant for the particular researchers (i.e., the
desired granularity of the parcellation). With respect to the
former point, one may conclude that an exact agreement
between the earlier results based on cortical microstructure
and our ﬁndings based on long-range connectivity proﬁles is
neither necessary nor likely. Concerning the latter point, the
question remains: How many subareas of the IPCC would rep-
resent the most appropriate parcellation? Here, we argue that
it is sensible to choose the most detailed description (i.e., the
largest number of areas) that still leads to a consistent pattern
across participants. Any attempt to produce ﬁner parcellations
would highlight interindividual differences, while any coarser
subdivision would miss potentially relevant features. The re-
maining variability of cluster size and location might be a

source to study the individual arrangement of
functional
zones in the IPC. Based on these considerations, the criterion
of long-range connectedness and using the current technol-
ogy to characterize this connectedness, we suggest that a sub-
division of the IPCC into 3 areas is the most appropriate.

Connectivity Pattern of the Human IPCC
This study shows strongest connections of the IPCC to the
lateral temporal, superior parietal, and pre- and postcentral
cortices in both hemispheres. The IPCC subareas are charac-
terized by a signiﬁcant rostral–caudal (i.e., IPCa-to-IPCp) de-
crease and increase in particular connectivity patterns to
certain cortical areas. A connectivity decrease from rostral to
caudal was identiﬁed to the superior temporal cortex in both
hemispheres, and an increase to the superior parietal cortex
in the left hemisphere.

In agreement with the study from Caspers et al. (2011), we
identiﬁed the strongest connections between all IPCC subar-
eas and the temporal cortex. We also found a comparable con-
nectivity pattern in the left and right hemispheres. On the
other hand, some of the rostral–caudal connectivity gradients

of the current work differ from the study of Caspers and col-
leagues, in which, for example, rostral areas are more con-
nected to somatosensory and superior parietal areas, while
caudal areas are predominantly connected to the auditory,
anterior temporal and occipital cortex. The connections pat-
terns are not directly comparable due to differences in the
methodology to compute the connectivity values from diffu-
sion tractography. However, the main difference consists in
the deﬁnition of seed and target regions. While we used the
voxels at the gray-white matter interface in the entire IPCC
subareas as seed region, Caspers et al. (2008) used a small
area representing the top 10% of the maximum probability
map and computed the connectivity values to a small target
zones within the target areas. Further on, their measures are
based on the connection likelihood and not on the connection
strength computed by probabilistic tractography.

Methodological Considerations
The measured diffusion signal is only an indirect measure of
the brain microstructure and, therefore, the derived tractogra-
phy does not directly reﬂect the ﬁne details of anatomical con-
nectivity (Jones et al. 2013). Some of the computed connections
might not exist in the brain (false-positive connections) and the
method cannot capture the full connectivity of the brain (false-
negative connections). The estimated connectivity values do not
represent the true axonal ﬁber-count in the living brain and are
only a relative measure of linkage between regions. Neverthe-
less, the computed estimation of the long-range connectivity is
a powerful criterion to separate cortical areas with different

connectivities, even if deﬁnite connectivity remains unknown.
Despite these limitations, diffusion tractography provides rel-
evant information of the white matter connectivity as shown in
numerous studies (e.g. Assaf and Pasternak 2008).

Homology—Comparison with Monkey data
Besides having optimal consistency across participants, the
proposed subdivision of human IPCC into 3 subareas ar-
ranged in rostral–caudal direction is also supported by its
similarity to the subdivision of the macaque IPCC (areas PF,
PFG, and PG), according to studies of cytoarchitecture (Gre-
goriou et al. 2006), tract tracing (Rozzi et al. 2006), and elec-
trophysiology (Rozzi et al. 2008). The small area Opt, the
fourth area in the macaque IPCC, which is located on the
boundary to the occipital
lobe markedly differs from the
other IPCC areas in terms of cytoarchitecture and connectivity
(Pandya and Seltzer 1982; Rozzi et al. 2006) and is not clearly
associated with the parietal lobe. We therefore excluded this
area from the comparative analysis.

The next question is whether the human and the macaque
areas are comparable with respect to their connectivity pat-
terns, and whether
there are any important differences
between the 2 species. In the macaque, areas PF, PFG, and
PG are connected with the lateral premotor cortex (areas F4
and F5) and the intraparietal and superior parietal cortices via
the SLF II/III (Rozzi et al. 2006; Schmahmann and Pandya
2006). Similarly, in humans, the areas IPCa, IPCm, and IPCp
are connected with the IFG (containing BA 44, the presumed
human homolog of macaque area F5) and the superior

parietal cortex. These similarities in parieto-frontal connec-
tions are also corroborated in a recent study by Thiebaut de
Schotten et al. (2011), who demonstrated a striking similarity
between the architecture of the SLF in both macaques and
humans.

In addition to these similarities, there are also clear differ-
ences (Fig. 8). In monkeys, only sparse connections seem to
exist between the IPCC and the temporal cortex (see Seltzer
and Pandya 1984; Fig. 8; Rozzi et al. 2006; Schmahmann et al.
2007). In marked contrast to that, in humans, strong connec-
tions exist between all 3 regions of the IPCC and the lateral
temporal cortex. These connections follow the posterior, ver-
tical section of the arcuate fascicle (Catani et al. 2005). [Con-
nections to deep white matter structures (e.g.,
the long
segment of the arcuate fascicle) were excluded by carefully
selecting the seed region at
interface (see
Materials and Methods).] Additionally, tractography revealed
strong connectivity of all 3 regions with the pre- and postcen-
tral gyri. These connections were not described in this extend
in the macaque monkey.

10 Tractography-Based Parcellation of the IPC • Ruschel et al.

The similarity in IPCC parcellation between macaques and
humans and the similar connections between the IPCC and
frontal and parietal regions suggest substantial conservation
in IPCC evolution between the 2 primate species. However, in
humans, new structural features emerged, such as the pro-
nounced pathway between the IPCC and temporal cortex,
which is possibly part of a perisylvian language network of
the human brain (Catani et al. 2005; Schmahmann et al. 2007;
Friederici 2009).

important cognitive networks,

The Functional Relevance of the IPCC Parcellation
As discussed in the Introduction, subareas of the IPCC are in-
volved in several
including
those subserving language, spatial attention, and episodic
memory. These networks have been investigated in numerous
functional brain imaging studies. We will now discuss how
the subareas we have found on the basis of tractography, as
well as the associated connectional ﬁngerprints, might relate
to these functional ﬁndings. Similar to Caspers et al. (2006),
we consider IPCm to be a transition area between the rostral
(IPCa) and caudal (IPCp) subregions of the IPCC, and IPCa
and IPCp as transition area to other cortical regions.

Rostral IPCC
The subarea IPCa covers the rostral part of the IPCC and
largely corresponds to the supramarginal gyrus. This area has
been interpreted to be involved in phonological processing
(Obleser et al. 2006) and, together with the dorsal part of the
IFG, in phonological working memory (Vigneau et al. 2006).
Similarly, the area was found active for phonology–orthogra-
phy mapping (Graves et al. 2010), phonological decision
(Hartwigsen et al. 2010), and subvocal articulation (Price
2010). This phonological network comprises, besides bilateral
IPCa and the IFG, posterior MTG and fusiform gyrus (Graves
et al. 2010). In contrast to these phonological ﬁndings, other
language functions seem to markedly exclude rostral IPCC
(Vigneau et al. 2006).

Furthermore, although lesions in the posterior parietal
cortex do not usually cause gross memory deﬁcits, imaging
studies have shown that the region is involved in episodic
memory (Cabeza et al. 2008). In particular, familiarity-based
episodic memory effects are primarily found in the supramar-
ginal gyrus (Vilberg and Rugg 2008).

Finally, rostral IPCC seems to store abstract somatosensory
information associated with tool use and complex movements
(Binder et al. 2009). Hence, it should be in close connection
with other motor and somatosensory areas, such as on the
pre- and postcentral gyri. Indeed, Rizzolatti and Craighero
(2004) have shown that the rostral IPCC belongs to the mirror
neuron network and is activated during imitation and obser-
vation of actions (see also Caspers et al. 2010). In these
studies, it was also shown that rostral IPCC coactivates with
premotor and somatosensory cortices.

Similar networks to the ones found by the experiments de-
scribed above also seem to emerge from resting-state fMRI
studies (e.g., Kelly et al. 2010).

In our analysis, we found substantial connections between
IPCa and all tested target regions. However, the regions most
strongly connected to IPCa comprise the IFG, pre- and post-
central gyri, as well as the temporal lobe (ITG, MTG, and
the
STG). This network includes, but

limited to,

is not

functionally connected areas discussed above (note that fusi-
form gyrus was not tested here).

Comparing the connection strength between the hemi-
spheres, we ﬁrst ﬁnd a right lateralization of connections
between IPCa and prefrontal (IFG and SFG), as well as
superior temporal (STG) areas. While the frontal connections
ﬁt well with a right lateralized visuo-spatial attention network
(Umarova et al. 2011), the meaning of the strongly right later-
alized STG and the strongly left lateralized MTG connections
remains somewhat unclear.

Caudal IPCC
The caudal subarea of the IPCC identiﬁed in our analysis
(IPCp) lies on the angular gyrus. The area has been discussed
as supporting semantic processes (Humphries et al. 2007)
and, together with parts of the IFG, to be involved in semantic
working memory (for a review see Vigneau et al. 2006).

In studies of visuo-spatial attention, besides the dorsal at-
tention network that subserves goal-directed attention, a
ventral bottom-up attention network has been discovered that
underlies the direction of attention towardssalient stimuli and
acts as a “circuit breaker” for the dorsal network (Corbetta
and Shulman 2002). This network recruits mainly angular
gyrus, as well as the posterior parts of MFG and IFG.

More generally, it seems that the caudal part of the IPCC
houses neuronal populations that are involved in processes of
high-level, complex and supramodal
integration, such as
decision-making, planning, problem solving, and sentence
comprehension (Binder et al. 2009).

In our study, the subareas, IPCm and IPCp, are also princi-
pally connected to all target areas. However, some areas are
particularly strongly connected, such as left SPL. This ﬁts with
the idea that this area has special involvement in networks of
episodic memory and spatial attention (Corbetta and Shulman
2002; Cabeza et al. 2008). On the other hand, IPCm and IPCp
are also strongly connected with temporal areas of
the
language network, thus corroborating their involvement in
language comprehension (Vigneau et al. 2006).

Concerning the interhemispheric differences between the
connections of caudal IPCC we ﬁnd that in the right hemisphere,
there are stronger connections to the PrCG (more posteriorly,
IPCp), and to IFG/SFG (more anteriorly, IPCm). This connection
pattern bears a striking resemblance to the SLF III system (see
Schmahmann et al. 2007), a ﬁber system whose right lateraliza-
tion has been shown to correlate to performance in visuospatial
attention tasks (Thiebaut de Schotten et al. 2011).

Conclusions
Our connectivity-based tripartition of the human IPCC as well
as the associated connectivity patterns are in principal agree-
ment with previous studies, both, based on diffusion tractogra-
phy and invasive methods. We extend the earlier work in
several ways. First, we provide direct insights into the inter-
subject variability of the parcellation. These data are also pro-
vided as an atlas in Supplementary data (Supplementary ﬁle 3).
Secondly, we directly assess the lateralization of parcellation
and connectivity ﬁngerprints of the subareas. While the par-
cellation showed only slight interhemispheric differences, the
associated connections are markedly different: In contrast to
the left hemisphere, the right anterior IPCC features stronger
prefrontal and superior temporal connectivities, posterior

IPCC is stronger connected to the superior parietal and pre-
frontal areas. Thirdly, we compare and extensively discuss the
relationship between our ﬁndings in humans and previous
tracing work in monkeys. While the rostro-caudal arrangement
of the subareas is similar to the ﬁndings in the macaque, the
connectivity patterns bear important differences,
in that,
humans in contrast to the monkeys have strong connections
between IPCC and temporal cortex, possibly related to the
human ability to process language. In summary, this study
gives a more complete picture of the structure of the IPCC and
provides a blueprint for similar investigations of other regions
of the cortex.
