Abstract

Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been successfully employed to obtain somatotopic maps of the
human sensorimotor cortex. Here, we showed through direct comparison that a similar functional map can be obtained, indepen-
dently of a task, by performing a connectivity-based parcellation of the sensorimotor cortex based on resting-state fMRI. Cortex
corresponding to two adjacent Brodmann areas (BA 3 and BA 4) was selected as the sensorimotor area. Parcellation was
obtained along a medial–lateral axis, which was conﬁrmed to be somatotopic (corresponding roughly to an upper, middle and
lower limb, respectively) by comparing it with maps obtained using motoric task-based fMRI in the same participants. Interest-
ingly, the resting-state parcellation map demonstrated higher correspondence to the task-based divisions after individuals per-
formed the motor task. Using the resting-state fMRI data, we also observed higher functional correlations between the centrally
located hand region and the other two regions, than between the foot and tongue. The functional relevance of these somatosen-
sory parcellation results indicates the feasibility of a wide range of potential applications to brain mapping.

Introduction
Classical approaches for parcellating the cerebral cortex are based
on histological features (Brodmann, 1909; Vogt & Vogt, 1919; Eco-
nomo, 1926; Sanides, 1970; Triarhou, 2007). The high interindividu-
al variability of the anatomical/functional areas and the difﬁculty of
using non-invasive imaging techniques to identify histological fea-
tures of brain tissue are the main motivations for developing novel
parcellation approaches (Amunts et al., 1999; Geyer et al., 2011;
Van Essen & Glasser, 2013). With non-invasive functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), the cerebral cortex can be parcellated
into different functional units via motivated tasks (Heeger & Ress,
2002). Recently, several groups have developed task-free methods
based on measures of structural and functional connectivity for the
parcellation of the human cerebral cortex, e.g. Broca area (Anwan-
der et al., 2007; Kelly et al., 2010), lateral premotor cortex (Schu-
botz et al., 2010), temporal pole (Fan et al., 2013), thalamus (Serra
et al., 2013), cingulate cortex (Beckmann et al., 2009; Yu et al.,
2011), primary motor (MI) area (Gorbach et al., 2011; Nebel et al.,
2012), medial frontal cortex (Johansen-Berg et al., 2004), frontal
pole (Liu et al., 2013), lateral frontal cortex (Goulas et al., 2012),

inferior parietal cortex (Ruschel et al., 2013), precuneal cortex (Mar-
gulies et al., 2009; Zhang & Li, 2012), lateral parietal cortex (Nel-
son et al., 2010), anterior cingulate cortex (Margulies et al., 2007)
supplementary motor area (Kim et al., 2010) and primary somato-
sensory (SI) cortex (Roca et al., 2010), etc. The advantage of these
methods is that no modality-speciﬁc tasks are necessary to identify
functional subregions, making it an ideal approach for characterising
brain organisation in clinical and longitudinal studies (Knosche &
Tittgemeyer, 2011; de Reus & van den Heuvel, 2013; Wig et al.,
2013b).

We aimed to parcellate the human sensorimotor cortex, consisting
of the contiguous MI and SI areas,
into functionally meaningful
subunits using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. Based on their
cytoarchitecture, the MI includes Brodmann area (BA) 4 (Campbell,
1905), and the SI includes BA 3, BA 1 and BA 2 (Brodmann,
1909; Vogt & Vogt, 1919; Geyer et al., 1999, 2000). The sensori-
motor cortex presented somatotopic organisation, with subregions
relating to different body parts (Penﬁeld & Boldrey, 1937; Kaas
et al., 1979; Okada et al., 1984). This organisation within the SI/MI
was also found via multiple motor/tactile tasks (Rao et al., 1995;
Stippich et al., 1999; Lotze et al., 2000; Meier et al., 2008; Buck-
ner et al., 2011).

Recently,

the subregions within the sensorimotor cortex were
found to be organised ventral-to-lateral using rs-fMRI or diffusion-
weighted imaging (van den Heuvel & Hulshoff Pol, 2010; Roca

resting-state sessions of 6 min each. The third and ﬁfth sessions were
motor-task sessions of 12 min each. For the resting-state sessions, 30
axially-oriented slices over the whole brain were collected with a vo-
xel size of 3 9 3 9 4.8 mm. For the task sessions, 20 coronally-ori-
ented slices with a voxel size of 2 9 2 9 2.2 mm were obtained
surrounding the central sulcus (Fig. 1A). The parameters for the mag-
netization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) T1-weighted
image sequence were: 12-channel coil, ﬂip angle, 9°; 176 slices; TR,
2300 ms; TE, 2.96 ms; voxel size, 1 9 1 9 1 mm; matrix size,
240 9 256; inversion time, 900 ms. Visual projection was by a mirror
ﬁxed to the head-coil and a projector located outside the scanner room.
Participants lay supine in the scanner with their head ﬁxed using
foam pads to minimise head motion. During the three resting-state ses-
sions (i.e. Rest1, Rest2 and Rest3), participants were instructed to
focus on a white ﬁxation cross with a black background, and to remain
motionless and not think of anything in particular. Rest3 was scanned
after the ﬁrst task session for the post-task effect investigation.

During the task session (i.e. Task1 and Task2), participants were
asked to perform a movement task (Fig. 1B). Each block included
25 s of active movement and 15 s of rest. There were three types of
movements in this task: ‘tapping right ﬁngers’, ‘moving tongue
within the mouth’, and ‘moving right foot and toes’. All movements
were performed at a self-deﬁned pace throughout the active block.
The German word for the respective body part (‘Hand’, ‘Fuß’ or
‘Zunge’) was displayed in place of the cross to indicate which body
part to move. The word was projected in white with a black back-
ground in the center of the mirror. For each body part, six blocks
were counterbalanced.

Dataset II: Human Connectome Project

A second dataset was provided by the Human Connectome Project
(HCP), supported by the WU–Minn Consortium and McDonnell
Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University (Van
Essen et al., 2013). The dataset consisted of 68 left-handed and
right-handed healthy participants (50 females) in the HCP quarter 1
(released online: March 2013). Thirty-six participants (18 females,
age 26–35 years) were selected for the present study, with speciﬁc
attention paid to matching male and female participants.

For each participant, one rs-fMRI session (with left-to-right
direction phase encoding) and the motor task fMRI session were

Nebel et al., 2012). Whether the extent of parcellations based on
rs-fMRI data spatially corresponds to these somatotopic subdivisions
remains to be quantitatively assessed. In the present study, we
assessed whether the parcellation of the primary sensorimotor cortex
using rs-fMRI corresponds to the representations of upper–middle–
lower limb segmentation.

Materials and methods

Data

Two datasets were included in the present study (Dataset I and II).
Each dataset was composed of rs-fMRI and motor task fMRI data
for the aim of comparing the results of functional connectivity-based
parcellation with the task-induced activation related to the movement
of body parts. Dataset I included one resting-state session that was
scanned after a task session in order to investigate the post-task
effect on the parcellation analysis.

Dataset I: Max Planck Institute

Participants

Nine right-handed adult participants were enrolled in the present study
at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Human Cognitive and Brain Sci-
ences in Leipzig (two females; age 27  2.12 years). All participants
were enrolled from the local university and had no history of any psy-
chiatric or neurological disease. The present study was approved by
the local ethics committee and written informed consent was given by
each participant. The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Associa-
tion (Declaration of Helsinki), printed in the British Medical Journal
(18 July 1964), was followed by the present study.

Magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition

All data were acquired using a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging
system (Verio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a
32-channel head-coil. The common parameters for all fMRI sessions
were as follows: gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence, inter-
leaved slice-timing, gap, 1 mm; repetition time (TR), 2 s; echo time
(TE), 30 ms; ﬂip angle, 90º; matrix size, 64 9 64. For each partici-
pant, ﬁve fMRI sessions were acquired with a break of 10 s in
between (Fig. 1C). The ﬁrst two sessions and the fourth session were

208 9 180 mm; slice thickness, 2.0 mm; 72 slices; voxels isotropic,
2.0 mm; multiband factor, 8; echo spacing, 0.58 ms; Bandwidth
(BW), 2290 Hz/Px; time points, 1200 (Feinberg et al., 2010; Moel-
ler et al., 2010; Setsompop et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012). The task
paradigm was similar to that used in the acquisition of the MPI
dataset. Participants were asked to move their right or left hand, toes
and tongue with 12-s blocks and a 3-s cue. A total of 284 time
points were obtained during the motor task session.

Analysis

Dataset I: Max Planck Institute

All images were preprocessed as follows using SPM5 (www.ﬁl.ion.
ucl.ac.uk/spm/): slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial
normalisation to the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 space, sam-
pled to 3 9 393 mm voxel size, and spatial smoothing with 6-mm
full-width at half-maximum of the Gaussian kernel. All participants
had < 1 voxel translation (3 mm) or 1° rotation head motion. For
the resting-state data,
the REST toolbox (www.restfmri.net/) was
used with the following parameters: (i) band-pass ﬁltering (0.01–
0.08 Hz); (ii) removing the linear trend of time courses; and (iii)
regressing out six head motion parameters, average time courses
from a white matter mask and a cerebral spinal ﬂuid mask (Fig. 2).

Task-based analysis

The activation maps of each body part were generated using a
general
linear model analysis in SPM5. A one-sample t-test was
performed on the beta intensity maps across participants for each

body part. All t-maps were thresholded at p < 0.05 using AlphaSim
in AFNI (Cox, 1996).

Connectivity-based parcellation analysis

The connectivity-based parcellation analysis was the same for all
three resting-state sessions (see Fig. 2).
1 Considering the anatomical variations across participants and the
spatial resolution of fMRI data, we selected an area including both
the MI and SI along the central sulcus. A template mask including
the left BA 4 and BA 3 from the Anatomy toolbox was selected as
the region of interest (ROI; Fig. 2-1; Geyer et al., 1999, 2000; Eick-
hoff et al., 2005).
2 Spatial correlation maps between each voxel within the ROI
were calculated and transformed using Fisher’s r-to-z (Vincent
et al., 2007; Yeo et al., 2011; Fig. 2-2).
3 An eta2 value was then calculated for each pair of voxels’
z-transformed connectivity maps, generating a similarity matrix
(Fig. 2–3) for each individual (Cohen et al., 2008). Group-level
analysis was conducted on data averaged across each resting-state
session from each participant separately.
4 Finally, both the individual similarity matrix and group-averaged
matrix were classiﬁed into between two and 10 clusters by spectral
K-means using the multicut clustering algorithm (Fig. 2-4/5; with
1000 iterations using the Spectral Clustering Toolbox; Meila & Shi,
2001; Kelly et al., 2010).
5 The optimal number of clusters was investigated using two
approaches at the group level. The Dice coefﬁcient (DC; from 0 to
1, where 1 is the highest overlap) was calculated for each k’s

cates the processing methods. The task images provided activation areas for foot, hand and tongue. From the resting-state images, clusters were generated based
on the correlation maps of voxels within the ROI. The results of the task and resting-state sessions were further analysed for similarity using the DC. FC, func-
tional connectivity; GLM, general linear model.

solution between the ﬁrst and second resting-state sessions to test
the stability of each k (Dice, 1945; Nebel et al., 2012). In addition
to the DC calculation, the silhouette was also calculated for the three
MPI resting-state sessions (Kelly et al., 2010). The silhouette value
is a ratio between the similarity of a voxel to others within the same
cluster and to those outside it. A higher silhouette indicated higher
reliability of the clusters.

Assessment of correspondence between task and resting
state

Three assessments evaluated the spatial correspondence between
task-derived regions and the resting-state clusters.

Group-level analysis

A winner-take-all (WTA) analysis was performed on the group-level
t-maps of two task sessions derived from the foot, hand and tongue
within the left BA 3 and BA 4 ROI (Meier et al., 2008). A voxel
was assigned as one limb area if the t-value of one body part was
higher
than the others. The overlap ratio was then calculated
between the WTA map and the three-cluster parcellation map from
three resting-state sessions. The DC was also calculated between
WTA maps of the two task sessions. Here the overlap ratio between
two maps that both had three clusters was not calculated cluster by
cluster as the normal DC. As both maps had the same number of
clusters and the same ROI size, the overlap ratio was calculated by
summing the number of overlap voxels for each pair of clusters, and
then dividing it by the number of voxels within the whole ROI.

Individual-level analysis

WTA analysis was performed on each individual’s Task1 t-maps of
the foot, hand and tongue within the ROI. For each k solution, the
DC was calculated between the area of the WTA map and the clus-
ters from the Rest1 parcellation map. The three highest cluster pairs
were averaged. The parcellation map with the highest average DC is
presented (Fig. 5). In addition, the averaged maximum DC value
between the Task1 WTA maps and the parcellation map of the
Rest2 and Rest3 was also calculated for each participant.

Within each cluster of the resting-state parcellation map (k = 3
for each session), the averaged and SD values of Task1’s group-
level t-maps (foot, hand and tongue) were calculated.

Assessing relationships between body parts

For the MPI data, a 6-mm radius sphere was created for the repre-
sentations of each body part centered on the group-level peak voxel
from each (foot: [ 3,  24, 75]; hand: [ 39,  21, 60];
tongue:
[ 54,  9, 33], MNI standard space). For each participant,
the
average time series within each sphere were correlated from the
three resting-state sessions.

Three clusters, which were selected from the parcellation maps of
each resting-state session, were used as the upper, middle and lower
limb regions. The correlation coefﬁcients between these clusters
lower limb region;
were then calculated (in Fig. 3B: red cluster,
green cluster, middle limb region; yellow cluster, upper
limb
region). For both correlation coefﬁcients (one obtained from Task1
and the other from resting-state clusters), a paired t-test between
middle–lower (i.e. hand–foot),
lower–upper (i.e. foot–tongue) and
middle–upper (i.e. hand–tongue) was performed across participants.

All fMRI data were ﬁrst preprocessed in the HCP pipeline using
FSL (FMRIB Software Library, Woolrich et al., 2001; Jenkinson

time
courses, regressing out six head motion parameters, average time
courses from a white matter mask and cerebral spinal ﬂuid mask.
For the task data, only the activation of the right hand, right foot
and tongue were selected. The WTA map was created based on
the t-map of these three body parts.

The parcellation analysis for the HCP quarter 1 data was per-
formed in the same way as for the MPI data. The BA 3/4 ROI was
used. The similarity matrix for each participant was generated via
the connectivity-based analysis. Three clusters were detected on the
group-level averaged similarity matrix using the spectral K-means
approach. The DC between the WTA map and group-level parcella-
tion map was calculated.

Results

Activation areas for body parts

The general
linear model analysis of the task sessions revealed
activation areas for the hand, foot and tongue for both task ses-
sions. Here we only focus on activations within the SI and MI.
Owing to the sensory aspect implicit in any motor task, the SI and
MI were both activated. The foot region was detected in the left
paracentral lobule, the hand region in the left pre/postcentral gyrus,
and the tongue region in the bilateral inferior post/precentral gyrus
(Fig. 3A). The activation areas for all body parts were consistent

Clustering of resting-state data

Three subregions were found on the group-level connectivity-based
parcellation analysis using the resting-state data (Fig. 3B, second
row). Consistent with hypotheses of somatotopic organisation, the
superior-most region was located ventromedially, a second region
was located dorsolaterally and a third region was located inferiolat-
erally. This spatial distribution was similar across three resting-state
sessions. This somatotopic organisation was also found in the
parcellation maps with different cluster numbers (Fig. 3C).

The Dice coefﬁcients (DCs) between the parcellation maps of the
two resting-state sessions indicated that high stability was found
when k was 3 (Fig. 4A). Across the three resting-state sessions, the
silhouette value was the highest when k was 2, and the second high-
est value in k was 3. All silhouette values did not change dramati-
cally across all k solutions (Fig. 4B).

Correspondence between task regions and resting-state
subregions

At the group-level, resting-state subregions corresponded to the sub-
regions observed in the task-based WTA map. All three parcellation
maps demonstrated a high DC (> 0.75) with the task’s WTA map
(Fig. 3B). Individual DCs between the parcellation map from the
Rest1 and the WTA map from Task1 are shown in Fig. 5A. All

participants’ maximum overlap DC ratios were greater than 0.55.
The highest DC in several individuals was observed for k > 3 due
to the detection of small clusters (e.g. s04 and s07) in the parcella-
tion analysis.

The averaged and SD values of three t-maps of Task1 within each
cluster are presented in Fig. 6. Each cluster from resting-state data
had the highest value to the t-map from only one body part. Their
spatial distribution was also somatotopically organised.

Post-task effect on the parcellation analysis

At the group level, the parcellation map of Rest3 presented the high-
est DC with Task1’s WTA map (Fig. 3B). At the individual level,
an increased trend of DC was observed from Rest1/Rest2 to Rest3
(Fig. 5B). Rest3 presented a signiﬁcantly higher DC than Rest2 and
Rest1 (P < 0.05) across participants. No signiﬁcant difference was
found between Rest1 and Rest2 (Fig. 5B).

Relationships between three body parts
The hand–foot, hand–tongue and foot–tongue correlation, using the
task-peak sphere and the clusters from the parcellation analysis,
were also examined across three resting-state sessions (Table 1,
left). Both the hand–foot and hand–tongue correlation were signiﬁ-
cantly higher than the foot–tongue correlation across participants
and the ﬁrst two resting-state sessions. Moreover, there was no sig-
niﬁcant difference between the hand–foot and hand–tongue correla-
tion (Table 1, right).

Results from the Human Connectome Project data

The activity areas of the right foot, right hand and tongue were sim-
ilar to those found in the MPI dataset (Fig. 7A), and the somatotop-
ic organisation was also observed. High correspondence between the
task WTA map and resting-state parcellation map was detected
(Fig. 7B; DC = 0.8441).

Discussion

We observed that rs-fMRI-based parcellation of the sensorimotor
cortex, corresponding to BA 3 and BA 4, identiﬁes somatotopically
arranged clusters
in two independent datasets. These clusters
correspond spatially to a somatotopic representation of upper–mid-
dle–lower
limb segmentation, as identiﬁed by task-based fMRI.
Interestingly, the resting-state parcellation map demonstrated higher
correspondence
to the
individuals
performed a motor task.

studies. The whole-brain voxel-wise

regions were subdivided into three clusters, depending on the indi-
vidual dataset, from dorsomedial to ventrolateral along the central
gyrus (Fig. 3). Considering the spatial resolution of fMRI and the
variation of anatomical structure near the central sulcus across par-
ticipants, we applied the connectivity-based parcellation analysis on
the conjunction of the MI and SI. Before the present study, several
previous studies had also found similar distribution of clusters
within the MI and SI by connectivity-based parcellation analysis
(Roca et al., 2010; Schubotz et al., 2010; Gorbach et al., 2011;
Nebel et al., 2012). Although the number of clusters was variable,
dorsomedial–ventrolateral organisation was a common feature across
these
connectivity-based
parcellation analysis also detected two parts of the somatomotor
area, dividing it into a lower face and upper hand–foot region dur-
ing rest (Yeo et al., 2011). Our study conﬁrmed that this somato-
topic organisation could be found using rs-fMRI data, and this
organisation was reliable across different resting-state sessions and
datasets. Importantly, we validated the somatotopic arrangement by
showing the correlation between subregions identiﬁed by resting-
state-based parcellation and representations of body parts as identi-
ﬁed by task-based fMRI. Different body sectors seem to have
characteristic functional connectivity features along the central gyrus
that have separable domains (van den Heuvel & Hulshoff Pol,
2010).

Resting-state clusters and activations related to different body
parts

We compared resting-state clusters and activation areas from the
task (Figs 3 and 6). For both datasets, ﬁrstly, three clusters were
found in the group-level analysis. These clusters were equally dis-
tributed and displayed high correspondence with the WTA map
derived from the tasks (Figs 3 and 6). A high overlap (DC > 0.75
for the MPI dataset; DC = 0.8441 for the HCP quarter 1 dataset)
conﬁrmed three distinguishable areas using two different
fMRI
modalities. Similar results were also found at the individual level
(Fig. 4A). The averaged value within each resting-state cluster
showed a good one-to-one correlation with the respective cerebral
representations of the different body parts (Fig. 5). Previous studies
had reported that the motor cortex consists of three separate sectors:
lower body, middle section and head (Meier et al., 2008; Yeo
et al., 2011; Weiss et al., 2012). According to our approach, these
three sectors could be distinguished from the others based only on
the resting-state functional connectivity patterns within the sensori-
motor cortex.

The post-task effect to the parcellation analysis

The Rest3 session was scanned after the Task1 session. Interest-
ingly, the parcellation maps of Rest3 showed higher correspondence
with the Task1 WTA map than the other two resting-state sessions
at both the group- and individual-level. It was reported that
the
resting-state needs a period of time to return to a task-free baseline
state after the performance of tasks (Barnes et al., 2009), and motor
learning can affect subsequent activity within resting-state networks
(Albert et al., 2009). The repetitive movements of alternate body
parts could be considered as a simple training task, and this task
affected the sensorimotor cortex functional organisation in the fol-
lowing resting state as the gap between Task1 and Rest3 was short
(around 20 s). The subdivisions of the sensorimotor cortex might
consolidate and vary through motor-training tasks (Taubert et al.,
2011; Tung et al., 2013). It was also possible that participants

found that
the task-activated regions presented increased signal
spectral power in the post-task session. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst time that this plasticity effect was detected in the resting-
state functional connectivity-based parcellation analysis. We sug-
gested that the functional subregions that were detected during the
resting state should take task effects into account. This effect could
also lead the morphometry difference between task-based regions
and resting-state regions.

For the MPI dataset, each participant performed three different
movements engaging the foot, hand, and tongue. The motoric activ-
ity was inherently accompanied by sensory stimulation. We asked
participants to perform these tasks in two separate sessions, in order
to identify whether the activations were robust and consistent. Sev-
eral studies had previously reported somatotopically arranged func-
tional regions corresponding to the hand, foot and tongue within the

be highly reproducible across different sessions (Weiss et al., 2012).
Our results showed similar stability of upper–middle–lower limb
segmentations across the two task sessions (Fig. 3). These patterns
were also found in the HCP quarter 1 dataset (Fig. 7A). These
results provide initial validation for describing the somatotopic
arrangement of subareas derived exclusively from rs-fMRI data.

Relationships between representations of body parts

The rs-fMRI data also allowed us to investigate the correlations
between the different somatotopically arranged clusters. The ipsilat-
eral right foot–hand and hand–tongue show similar correlation val-
ues, which were both higher than the foot–tongue relationship. The
foot–tongue presented no signiﬁcant correlation. This result was

similar to the ﬁndings of Yeo et al. (2011). They found a higher
correlation between the right foot–hand than between hand–tongue,
and the lowest correlation between foot–tongue. Unlike the current
ﬁndings, Yeo et al. (2011) found the foot–tongue to have a signiﬁ-
cant correlation. Although these different results may be explained
by the substantially larger sample size (n = 1000) in the study of
Yeo et al. (2011), the ranking of the three pairs was nonetheless
consistent.

Although the spatial proximity of hand, foot, and tongue repre-
sentation in the brain may contribute to the current ﬁndings, the

correlation of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal
between body parts may also be explained by basic motor habits. The
hands and feet present high interlimb coordination (Swinnen & Car-
son, 2002), and hand and tongue coordination is frequently necessary,
e.g. during talking and eating (Gentilucci & Campione, 2011). In con-
trast, the foot and tongue are rarely behaviorally coupled. Spontane-
ous movements (or movement inhibition) in the magnetic resonance
imaging scanner could also contribute to our ﬁndings.

Limitations
Although a ‘standard’ spatial resolution of 3 mm3 was used in the
present study, it might not be precise enough to differentiate small
anatomical units in sensorimotor areas. In our parcellation analysis,
boundaries were only detected between upper, middle and lower
limb, which was conﬁrmed by the dominant activation area of foot,
hand and tongue. These three sections might also be activated by
movement of other body parts, e.g. arm and lips, which was beyond
the scope of the current study. The segments also have smaller units
such as toes and ﬁngers, which could be detected by fMRI (Blank-
enburg et al., 2003; Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012). In future stud-
ies, a higher spatial resolution could allow for a higher number of
parcellations targeting smaller functional units. Also, the peak activ-
ity area for a speciﬁc body part, such as the tip of the index ﬁnger,
could help in investigating resting-state subregions,

boundary detection from WTA analysis of task images (Meier et al.,
2008).

rather

The estimation of the optimal number of clusters in the sensori-
motor cortex required a priori knowledge and remains a methodo-
logical challenge. To date, several studies have taken the measure of
cluster stability across bilateral areas (Kahnt et al., 2012), sessions
(Nebel et al., 2012) and individuals (Schubotz et al., 2010; Liu
et al., 2013) to select the optimal number of clusters. Cluster param-
eters such as silhouette have also been employed for cluster number
validation (Kelly et al., 2010). In the present study, the three body
parts investigated limited the desired cluster number. Despite a
range of cluster numbers investigated, we focused here on the three-
cluster solution to match the number of activated areas.

Conclusions

We were able to identify segregated functional regions within the
left MI/SI using rs-fMRI and validate its somatotopic arrangement
through comparison to task-based activations with two independent
datasets. The posteffect of the motor task on the resting-state parcel-
lation map was observed. This methodology may also be applicable
to clinical investigation requiring the identiﬁcation of different body
parts. The question remains regarding the level of detail
that rs-
fMRI may be able to provide for characterising functional regions.
Improvements in spatial resolution will enable the investigation of
unique dynamics between the MI and SI, as well as potentially
further subdivisions consistent with cytoarchitectonic areas.
