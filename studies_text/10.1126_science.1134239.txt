plants by scavenging the damaging reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generated by the plant
defense mechanisms in response to environ-
mental stress (15). The leaves of nonsymbiotic
plants generated detectable ROS when stressed
with heat, whereas those of symbiotically
colonized plants did not (table S1). However,
there was no difference in the ROS response
to heat between plants inoculated with the
virus-free and the CThTV-infected isolates of
C. protuberata.

Complex tripartite symbioses have been found
among arthropods, bacteria, and mutualistic bac-
teriophages (16, 17). This study reports a three-
way mutualistic symbiosis involving a virus, a
fungal endophyte, and either a monocot or eudicot
plant.

The Neural Basis of Loss Aversion
in Decision-Making Under Risk
Sabrina M. Tom,1 Craig R. Fox,1,2 Christopher Trepel,2 Russell A. Poldrack1,3,4*

People typically exhibit greater sensitivity to losses than to equivalent gains when making
decisions. We investigated neural correlates of loss aversion while individuals decided whether to
accept or reject gambles that offered a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing money. A broad set of
areas (including midbrain dopaminergic regions and their targets) showed increasing activity as
potential gains increased. Potential losses were represented by decreasing activity in several of
these same gain-sensitive areas. Finally, individual differences in behavioral loss aversion were
predicted by a measure of neural loss aversion in several regions, including the ventral striatum
and prefrontal cortex.

Many decisions, such as whether to in-

vest in the stock market or to accept a
involve the possibility of
new job,
gaining or losing relative to the status quo. When
faced with such decisions, most people are
markedly risk averse. For instance, people typ-
ically reject gambles that offer a 50/50 chance of
gaining or losing money, unless the amount that
could be gained is at least twice the amount that
could be lost (e.g., a 50/50 chance to either gain
$100 or lose $50) (1). Prospect theory, the most
successful behavioral model of decision-making
under risk and uncertainty (1, 2), explains risk
aversion for “mixed” (gain/loss) gambles using

the concept of loss aversion: People are more
sensitive to the possibility of losing objects or
money than they are to the possibility of gaining
the same objects or amounts of money (1, 3–5).
Thus, people typically require a potential gain of
at least $100 to make up for exposure to a
potential
loss of $50 because the subjective
impact of losses is roughly twice that of gains.
Similarly, people demand substantially more
money to part with objects that they have been
given than what they would have been willing to
pay to acquire those objects in the first place (6).
Loss aversion also has been used to explain a
wide range of economic behaviors outside the
laboratory (7, 8). Further, loss aversion is seen in
trading behavior of both children as young as age
five (9) and capuchin monkeys (10), which sug-
gests that it may reflect a fundamental feature of
how potential outcomes are assessed by the
primate brain.

Previous neuroimaging studies of responses
to monetary gains or losses have focused on ac-
tivity associated with the anticipation of im-

mediate outcomes (“anticipated” utility) (11, 12)
or the actual experience of gaining or losing
money (“experienced” utility) (11, 13, 14) rather
than specifically investigating which brain sys-
tems represent potential losses versus gains when
a decision is being made (“decision” utility). Be-
havioral researchers have shown that anticipated,
experienced, and decision utilities often diverge
in dramatic ways, which raises the possibility that
the corresponding brain systems involved may
also differ (15). In the current study, we aimed to
isolate activity associated with the evaluation of a
gamble when choosing whether or not to accept
it (i.e., decision utility) without the expectation
that the gamble would be immediately resolved.
This allowed us to test whether neural responses
during the evaluation of potential outcomes are
similar to patterns previously reported in studies
of anticipated and experienced outcomes.

One fundamental question for the study of
decision-making is whether loss aversion reflects
the engagement of distinct emotional processes
when potential losses are considered. It has been
suggested that enhanced sensitivity to losses is
driven by negative emotions, such as fear or
anxiety (16). This notion predicts that exposure to
increasing potential losses should be associated
with increased activity in brain structures thought
to mediate negative emotions in decision-making
[such as the amygdala or anterior insula; compare
with (17, 18)]. Alternatively, loss aversion could
reflect an asymmetric response to losses versus
gains within a single system that codes for the
subjective value of the potential gamble, such
as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)/
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum
(11, 19, 20).

To examine the neural systems that process
decision utility, we collected functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) data while partici-

pants decided whether to accept or reject mixed
gambles that offered a 50/50 chance of either
gaining one amount of money or losing another
amount (Fig. 1A) (21). To encourage participants
to reflect on the subjective attractiveness of each
gamble rather than to rely on a fixed decision
rule, we asked them to indicate one of four re-
sponses to each gamble (strongly accept, weakly
accept, weakly reject, and strongly reject). In
order to allow for separate estimates of neural
responses to gains and losses, the sizes of the
potential gain and loss were manipulated inde-
pendently, with gains ranging from $10 to $40 (in
increments of $2) and losses ranging from $5 to
$20 (in increments of $1). We chose these ranges
because previous studies indicate that people are,
on average, roughly twice as sensitive to losses as
to gains (1, 5); thus, we expected that, for most
participants, this range of gambles would elicit a
wide range of attitudes, from strong acceptance
to indifference to strong rejection. To introduce
incentive-compatible payoffs, we endowed par-
ticipants with $30 one week before scanning and
told participants that one decision from each of
three scanning runs would be honored for real
money.

We assessed behavioral sensitivity to gains
and losses by fitting a logistic regression to each
participant’s acceptability judgments collected
during scanning, using the size of the gain and
loss as independent variables. Based on this
analysis, we computed a measure of behavioral
loss aversion l as the ratio of the (absolute) loss
response to the gain response, which yielded a
median l = 1.93 (range: 0.99 to 6.75). This find-
ing is consistent with the observations that par-
ticipants were, on average, indifferent to gambles
in which the potential gain was twice the amount
of the potential loss (Fig. 1B) and that participants
were slower to decide whether or not to accept
these gambles (Fig. 1C). These behavioral data
also accord well with previous findings (1, 5).

We first analyzed the imaging data to identify
brain regions whose activation correlated with
the size of the potential gain or loss, using para-
metric regressors (21). This analysis isolated a set
of regions responsive to the size of potential
gains when evaluating gambles (averaging over
levels of loss) (Fig. 2 and fig. S2). The gain-
responsive network included regions previously
shown to be associated with the anticipation and
receipt of monetary rewards, including the dorsal
and ventral striatum, VMPFC, ventrolateral PFC,
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), OFC, and
dopaminergic midbrain regions. There were no
regions that showed decreasing activation as
gains increased.

If loss aversion is driven by a negative af-
fective response (e.g., fear, vigilance, discom-
fort), then one would expect increasing activity in
brain regions associated with these emotions as
the size of the potential loss increases. Contrary
to this prediction, no brain regions showed sig-
nificantly increasing activation during evaluation
of gambles as the size of the potential loss in-

creased (averaging over all levels of gain). In-
stead, a group of brain regions including the
striatum, VMPFC, ventral ACC, and medial
OFC, most of which also coded for gains, showed
decreasing activity as the size of the potential loss
increased (Fig. 2 and fig. S3). A conjunction
analysis between increasing activity for gains and
decreasing activity for losses demonstrated joint
sensitivity to both gains and losses in a set of
regions, including the dorsal and ventral striatum
and VMPFC (Fig. 3 and table S1).

In order to ensure that potential loss–related
responses were not being obscured by the overall
positive expected value of the gambles, we
compared activity evoked by the worst possible
gambles (gain: $10 to $16; loss: $17 to $20) and

the best possible gambles (gain: $34 to $40; loss:
$5 to $8). In a whole-brain analysis, there were
no regions that showed significantly more ac-
tivity for the worst gambles as compared to that
for the best gambles (corrected P > 0.4 in all
voxels by means of randomization tests). Given
the specific prediction regarding loss-related ac-
tivity in the amygdala and insula based on pre-
vious studies of experienced utility and risk
aversion (11, 18), we performed further analyses
that focused on these areas. Even at a very liberal
uncorrected threshold of P < 0.01, there were no
significant voxels in the amygdala and only two
single unconnected voxels in the insula. By com-
parison, at the same threshold, there were large
clusters of activation for the best versus the worst

gambles in the ventral striatum and VMPFC. Al-
though null results in f MRI must be interpreted
with caution, these results are consistent with
the conclusion that losses and gains are coded
by the same mechanism rather than by two
separate mechanisms. Moreover, this aggre-
gate representation of decision utility appears
to be represented by the same neural circuitry
that is engaged by a range of experienced re-
wards (11). These results support previous
studies showing increased and decreased ac-
tivity in the striatum for experienced monetary
gains and losses, respectively (11, 13).

We next investigated whether individual dif-
ferences in brain activity during decision-making
were related to individual differences in behavior,
using whole-brain analyses to identify regions
where the neural response to gains or losses was
correlated with behavioral loss aversion. Unex-
pectedly, greater behavioral loss aversion was
associated with greater neural sensitivity not only
to losses but also to gains. For increasing gains,
we observed a significant correlation with
behavioral
loss aversion in the sensorimotor
cortex and superior frontal cortex (fig. S4). On
the other hand, as potential losses increased, an
extensive set of areas showed a more rapidly
decreasing response to mounting losses among
individuals who were more loss averse (fig. S5).
Notably, these regions encompassed many of
the areas that showed an overall decrease in
neural activity with increasing potential loss.
The association of decreased behavioral loss
aversion with decreased neural responses to
both losses and gains during decision-making is
consistent with the long-standing notion that
some forms of risk taking may have their roots
in sensation seeking by individuals who have a
diminished physiological response to stimula-
tion (22).

Examination of regions of interest in the
striatum and VMPFC from the gain/loss con-
junction analysis (Fig. 3) revealed that these

regions exhibited a pattern of “neural loss aver-
sion”; that is, the (negative) slope of the decrease
in activity for increasing losses was greater than
the slope of the increase in activity for increas-
ing gains in a majority of participants (striatum:
loss > gain for 14 out of 16 participants, P =
0.004; VMPFC: loss > gain for 13 out of 16
participants, P = 0.021). In order to more directly
assess the relationship between neural loss aver-
sion and behavioral loss aversion, we performed
a whole-brain robust regression analysis with
these measures (21). This analysis revealed
significant correlations between behavioral and
neural loss aversion in several regions, including
bilateral ventral striatum (Fig. 4), bilateral lateral
and superior PFC (pre-supplementary motor
area), and right inferior parietal cortex (figs. S6
and S7 and table S2). These results demonstrate
that differences in behavior were strongly pre-
dicted by differences in neural responses.

The present study replicates the common
behavioral pattern of risk aversion for mixed
gambles that offer a 50/50 chance of gaining or
losing money and shows that this pattern of
behavior is directly tied to the brain’s greater
sensitivity to potential losses than gains. These
results provide evidence in favor of one of the
fundamental claims of prospect theory (1, 2),
namely that the function that maps money to
subjective value is markedly steeper for losses
than gains [see also (4)]. Moreover, mediation
analysis (21) suggests that individual differences
in behavioral loss aversion (as inferred by will-
ingness to accept mixed gambles) are driven
primarily by individual differences in neural sen-
sitivity to potential losses. Although the present
study focuses on loss aversion in the context of
mixed gambles, recent work has found that the
coefficient of loss aversion (i.e., the ratio of sen-
sitivity to losses versus gains) is highly correlated
across risky and riskless contexts (23). Therefore,
we surmise that a similar mechanism may con-
tribute to other manifestations of loss aversion.

REPORTS

Previous studies have shown that anticipated
or experienced losses give rise to activation in
regions that have been associated with negative
emotions, such as the amygdala or anterior insula
(11, 17, 18). In contrast, the present study dem-
onstrates that, in the context of decision-making,
potential losses are represented by decreasing
activity in regions that seem to code for sub-
jective value rather than by increasing activity in
regions associated with negative emotions. This
difference between present and previous results
reinforces the importance of distinguishing
among experienced, anticipated, and decision
utility in economic theories of choice (15). It is
possible that amygdala engagement for ex-
perienced losses reflects negative prediction error
(11, 24) rather than negative value, whereas the
lack of immediate outcomes in the present study
(which was designed to isolate decision utility)
precludes the computation of prediction errors.

The neural basis of decision under risk was
investigated in a recent study by De Martino
et al. (25), who found that amygdala activity
correlated with choices of risky gambles framed
as losses and sure outcomes framed as gains.
However, the reflection in risk attitudes when
moderate-probability gambles are framed as losses
versus gains has been attributed in prospect theory
primarily to the reflection in curvature of the value
function for losses versus gains (2) and secondar-
ily to distortions in probability weighting rather
than to loss aversion. In contrast, we asked partici-
pants in the present study to evaluate balanced
(50/50) gain/loss gambles, which allowed us to
isolate the role of loss aversion. Thus, although
amygdala activation may play a role in some
decisions under risk, it does not appear to be a
necessary component in loss aversion.

REPORTS

The present results illustrate how neuroim-
aging can be used to directly test predictions
stemming from behavioral theories: in this case,
the prediction from prospect theory that risk
aversion for mixed gambles can be attributed to
enhanced sensitivity to losses. Neural loss aver-
sion was observed throughout, though not strict-
ly limited to, the targets of the mesolimbic and
mesocortical dopamine (DA) systems. It is tempt-
ing to speculate that individual differences in
behavioral and neural loss aversion observed in
the present study may be related to naturally oc-
curring differences in DA function, though the
relationship between genetic variation in the
DA system and personality traits such as impul-
sivity and risk taking remains largely unknown
(26). Further, the diminished neural sensitivity
to losses among individuals who were less loss
averse (i.e., more risk seeking) may shed light
on a number of neuropsychiatric and behav-
ioral disorders, such as substance abuse, path-
ological gambling, and antisocial personality
disorder, that are associated with increased risk
taking and impulsive behavior. This suggests
that studies integrating methods from behavior-
al economics and cognitive neuroscience may
provide greater insight into the nature of these
disorders.

Asymmetric Inheritance of Mother
Versus Daughter Centrosome
in Stem Cell Division
Yukiko M. Yamashita,1*† Anthony P. Mahowald,2 Julie R. Perlin,1 Margaret T. Fuller1,3†

Adult stem cells often divide asymmetrically to produce one self-renewed stem cell and one
differentiating cell, thus maintaining both populations. The asymmetric outcome of stem cell
divisions can be specified by an oriented spindle and local self-renewal signals from the stem cell
niche. Here we show that developmentally programmed asymmetric behavior and inheritance of
mother and daughter centrosomes underlies the stereotyped spindle orientation and asymmetric
outcome of stem cell divisions in the Drosophila male germ line. The mother centrosome remains
anchored near the niche while the daughter centrosome migrates to the opposite side of the
cell before spindle formation.

Adult stem cells maintain populations of

highly differentiated but short-lived
cells throughout the life of the orga-
nism. To maintain the critical balance between
stem cell and differentiating cell populations,

stem cells have a potential to divide asymmet-
rically, producing one stem and one differen-
tiating cell (1). The asymmetric outcome of
stem cell divisions can be specified by regulated
spindle orientation, such that the two daughter
cells are placed in different microenvironments
that either specify stem cell identity (stem cell
niche) or allow differentiation (2, 3).

Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs)
are maintained through attachment to somatic
hub cells, which constitute the stem cell niche.
Hub cells secrete the signaling ligand Upd, which
activates the Janus kinase–signal transducer and
activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) path-
way in the neighboring germ cells to specify
stem cell identity (4, 5). Drosophila male GSCs

normally divide asymmetrically, producing one
stem cell, which remains attached to the hub,
and one gonialblast, which initiates differentia-
tion. This stereotyped asymmetric outcome is
controlled by the orientation of the mitotic
spindle in GSCs: The spindle lies perpendicular
to the hub so that one daughter cell inherits the
attachment to the hub, whereas the other is dis-
placed away (6).

The stereotyped orientation of the mitotic
spindle is set up by the positioning of centro-
somes during interphase (Fig. 1A) (6). GSCs
remain oriented toward the niche throughout the
cell cycle. In G1 phase, the single centrosome is
located near the interface with the hub. When the
duplicated centrosomes separate in G2 phase, one
stays next to the hub, whereas the other migrates
to the opposite side of the cell. Centrosomes
in the GSCs separate unusually early in inter-
phase, rather than at the G2-prophase transition,
so it is common to see GSCs with fully separated
centrosomes without a spindle (of >500 GSCs in
the 0- to 3-day-old males counted, ~40% of the
GSCs had two centrosomes that were separated
to opposite sides of the cell, but no spindle was
yet assembled) (6).

Differences between the mother and daughter
centrosomes underlie the stereotyped behavior
of the centrosomes in Drosophila male GSCs.
The mother centrosome normally remains an-
chored to the hub-GSC interface and is inherited
by the GSC, whereas the daughter centrosome
moves away from the hub and is inherited by
the cell that commits to differentiation. Mother
and daughter centrosomes were differentially
