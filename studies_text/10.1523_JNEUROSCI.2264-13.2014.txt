The striking homogeneity of cerebellar microanatomy is strongly suggestive of a corresponding uniformity of function. Consequently,
theoretical models of the cerebellum’s role in motor control should offer important clues regarding cerebellar contributions to cognition.
One such influential theory holds that the cerebellum encodes internal models, neural representations of the context-specific dynamic
properties of an object, to facilitate predictive control when manipulating the object. The present study examined whether this theoretical
construct can shed light on the contribution of the cerebellum to language processing. We reasoned that the cerebellum might perform a
similar coordinative function when the context provided by the initial part of a sentence can be highly predictive of the end of the sentence.
Using functional MRI in humans we tested two predictions derived from this hypothesis, building on previous neuroimaging studies of
internal models in motor control. First, focal cerebellar activation–reflecting the operation of acquired internal models–should be
enhanced when the linguistic context leads terminal words to be predictable. Second, more widespread activation should be observed
when such predictions are violated, reflecting the processing of error signals that can be used to update internal models. Both predictions
were confirmed, with predictability and prediction violations associated with increased blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the
posterior cerebellum (Crus I/II). Our results provide further evidence for cerebellar involvement in predictive language processing and
suggest that the notion of cerebellar internal models may be extended to the language domain.

Introduction
While there is an emerging consensus on cerebellar involvement
in a wide range of cognitive tasks, including language processing
(Strick et al., 2009, but see Glickstein et al., 2011), a computa-
tional account of how this subcortical structure contributes to
cognition remains elusive. Importantly, the striking microana-
tomical homogeneity of the cerebellum suggests a corresponding
unity of function across motor and non-motor domains (Ram-
nani, 2006), and has inspired the idea that theories developed for
motor control should be informative for understanding cerebel-
lar contributions to cognition. One influential theory posits that
the cerebellum encodes internal models, neural representations
of the essential dynamic properties of an object (e.g., body part or
tool) that can be used to predict and control actions involving
that object within a particular context (Wolpert et al., 1995; Ito,
2006), or contribute to cognition by similarly encoding the

context-specific dynamics of more abstract representations
(Ramnani, 2006; Ito, 2008).

Internal models are acquired and formed by supervised, or
error-based learning (Doya, 1999): the model is continuously
modified if its output, the predicted state of the system, does not
match the actual or observed state. Functional MRI (fMRI) stud-
ies of motor control have provided evidence of prediction error
signals in the human cerebellum (Imamizu et al., 2000; but see
Diedrichsen et al., 2005; Schlerf et al., 2012). Moreover, when
controlling for error magnitude, changes in more focal cerebellar
activation were consistent with the development of an acquired
internal model (Imamizu et al., 2000). These findings suggest that
activation patterns within the cerebellum reflect the generation of
predictions and processing of prediction error signals, two key
characteristics of internal models.

Neuroimaging studies of linguistic processing have consis-
tently reported activation within the cerebellum (for review, see
Murdoch, 2010). The functional correlates of these activation
patterns, however, remain unclear, especially as motor-based ac-
counts such as covert rehearsal have failed to hold up to experi-
mental investigation (Chein and Fiez, 2001; Ravizza et al., 2006).
Interestingly, the neuroscience of language has in recent years
increasingly focused on predictive mechanisms (Poeppel et al.,
2012), either treating language within the broader theoretical
context of predictive coding (Gagnepain et al., 2012) or explicitly
using the concept of internal models (Pickering and Garrod,
2013).

Thus, our aim in the current study was to test whether the
notion of internal models can help shed light on the cerebellar
role in language processing. Specifically, we reasoned that cere-
bellar internal models might aid sentence comprehension, by
using the context of a partially presented sentence to predict the
next word. A recent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
study has provided support for this generalization of the internal
model hypothesis to language (Lesage et al., 2012). Here, we use
fMRI to obtain converging evidence and test additional predic-
tions of this hypothesis.

Building on neuroimaging studies examining the role of the cer-
ebellum in internal models for motor control, we tested two key
predictions: (1) focal cerebellar activation, reflecting the engagement
of a learned internal model, should be observed when the sentence
context makes the final word predictable and (2) more widespread
activation should be observed when this prediction is violated, re-
flecting the processing of error signals that can be used to update the
internal model or create a novel internal model.

Based on recent meta-analyses, we expected these activations
in the posterior cerebellum, predominantly in the right cerebellar
hemisphere (Stoodley and Schmahmann, 2009; E et al., 2014).
Materials and Methods
Participants. All participants were self-reported as right-handed, had
normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no known neurological deficits,
and were fluent in Norwegian. Of the 39 participants recruited for the
study, two were excluded due to abnormalities discovered on MRI, and
five others due to excessive head movement in the scanner, leaving a final
sample of 32 (21 female, mean age 26.2 (SD ⫽ 9.08)). All participants
provided oral and written informed consent. The study was approved by
the Regional Ethics Committee and was conducted in accordance with
ethical standards specified in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.

Experimental procedure. An illustration of the task structure is given in
Figure 1. Briefly, on each trial, the participant viewed a fixation cross,
followed by a visual prompt (asterisk) and a sequence of five centrally
presented words (in lower case). Each of these stimuli was presented for
750 ms, and there was no pause between successive stimuli (0 ms inter-
stimulus interval). We used a fixed rate of stimulus presentation to min-
imize the disruptive effects of serial reading, while placing minimal
demands on working memory.

The crucial experimental variable, the predictability of the terminal,
target word, was manipulated by varying the context established by the
initial four words. In the Congruent condition, sentences were con-
structed so that the target word was highly predictable (e.g., “two plus
two is four.”). In the Incongruent condition, the sentences were also
designed such that the target word was highly predictable, but the pre-
diction was violated by presenting a terminal word that was inappropri-
ate given the context (e.g., “[the water] had frozen to cars”). In the
Scrambled condition, the initial four words did not establish a context for
a grammatical sentence (e.g., “fast in clock plane”), and thus the target

word was not predictable (e.g., “through”). We also included a Letter
String condition to control for the visual and motor aspects of the task,
replacing the words with meaningless letter strings of identical conso-
nants (e.g., “rrr gggg nnnn pp kkkk”).

Immediately after the presentation of the target word (or consonant
string), the question, “Was the sentence meaningful?” was presented on
the screen, indicating that the participant should judge whether or not
the sequence constituted a meaningful sentence (Congruent condition vs
Incongruent, Scrambled, and Letter String conditions). This question
was displayed for 3000 ms and the participant was required to respond
within this time window by pressing one of two buttons with his/her right
hand, using the index finger (“yes”) or thumb (“no”). Participants were
instructed to wait for the question before answering, and were told that
there was no need to respond quickly. The onset of the next trial followed
directly after the offset of the question.

The entire experiment consisted of 30 trials per condition, plus 15 null
trials in which an asterisk replaced the words/letters for the full trial
duration. The order of the 135 trials was randomized. Stimuli were presented
using E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools) and MR-compatible
goggles with two LCD-displays (VisualSystems; NordicNeuroLab), while
responses were collected using an MR-compatible response grip with two
response buttons (ResponseGrip; NordicNeuroLab). The total duration of
the single functional scanning run was ⬃19 min.

The sentence stimuli used in the present experiment were constructed
with the aim of maximizing the predictability of the final word in the
congruent and incongruent conditions, with the additional constraint
that the presented target word in the incongruent condition constitute a
violation of these predictions. We confirmed this by presenting 100 par-
ticipants with the context phrase (four initial words) for the 30 congruent
and 30 incongruent sentences and asking them to generate a terminal,
target word. Cloze probability, the ratio of participants who used the
actual target word to complete the sentences, was 0.85 (SD: 0.19) for
congruent sentences and 0 for incongruent sentences. Word frequency,
defined as the number of occurrences per million words, was extracted
from a large database of Norwegian words (The Text Laboratory, ILN,
University of Oslo; http://www.tekstlab.uio.no/frekvensordlister/).

A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to compare the condi-
tions in terms of word frequency given that this variable is known to
influence the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response
(Chee et al., 2002; Carreiras et al., 2006; Grande et al., 2011). When all five
words were included, there was no significant difference between condi-
tions in word frequency (F(2,447) ⫽ 1.309, p ⫽ 0.271). However, if the
analysis is restricted to the target words, the effect of condition was reli-
able (F(2,87) ⫽ 3.944, p ⬍ 0.05), with the difference occurring because a
number of high-frequency function words (e.g., “and” and “in”) ap-
peared in the target position for some of the “sentences” in the scrambled
condition. Given the frequency differences, a post hoc procedure was
applied to the stimulus sets to equate the conditions for target word
frequency. We excluded six to eight sentences for each condition, elimi-
nating those sentences in which the target word was at either extreme in
terms of frequency (high or low frequency). This approach effectively
equalized mean word frequency across conditions (F(2,67) ⫽ 0.241,

p ⫽ 0.787; Means: Congruent: 16.56 [13.54]; Incongruent: 15.04 [15.83];
Scrambled: 13.27 [18.46]), with the penalty of slightly reducing power by
reducing the number of trials per condition. All fMRI analyses were
performed both with the full set of sentences and with the pruned sen-
tence sets in which word frequency was better controlled.

Scan acquisition. Scanning was conducted on a 3 T, Phillips Achieva
whole-body scanner, with an 8 channel Philips SENSE head coil (Philips
Medical Systems). Functional images were obtained with a single-shot
T2* weighted echo planar imaging sequence (repetition time (TR): 2000
ms; slice echo time (TE): 30 ms; field of view (FOV): 240 ⫻ 240 ⫻ 108;
imaging matrix: 80 ⫻ 80; flip angle 80° 36 axial slices, interleaved at 3 mm
thickness, no gap, voxel size 3 ⫻ 3 ⫻ 3 mm). The scanning session
consisted of 563 volumes, synchronized to the onset of the experiment.
To obtain complete coverage of the cerebellum, the slice orientation was
adjusted to be ⬃45° relative to the line running from the anterior to
posterior commissure. This orientation resulted in parts of the posterior
frontal lobe and superior parietal lobe falling outside the FOV. A T1
weighted anatomical image with a voxel size of 1 ⫻ 1 ⫻ 1 mm was
recorded for registration of the functional images (180 sagittal slices; TR:
8.5 ms; TE: 2.3 ms; FOV: 256 ⫻ 256 ⫻ 180; flip angle: 7°).

Imaging analysis. Functional images were converted to 4D NIfTI files
(http://lcni.uoregon.edu/⬃jolinda/MRIConvert/) and analyzed using
SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8). Images were
corrected for slice timing, realigned to correct for residual head move-
ment, and coregistered to the anatomical image. Following these prepro-
cessing steps, the analysis stream was split into a cerebellum-specific
analysis to address the main hypotheses of the study, and a whole-brain
analysis to examine cerebral activation patterns.

For the cerebellum-specific analysis, unsmoothed images were first
analyzed in native space using a general linear model (GLM). Event-
related regressors, modeled as delta functions time locked to the onset of
the target word, were created for the four trial types (congruent, incon-
gruent, scrambled, letter strings). These functions were convolved with
the canonical hemodynamic response function. Low-frequency drifts
were removed using a high-pass filter (cutoff 128 s) and six head motion
parameters from the realignment step were included as additional regres-
sors. Serial correlations in fMRI time series were accounted for by the
autoregressive AR(1) model.

The anatomical images were normalized to a high-resolution cere-
bellar template Spatially Unbiased Infratentorial Template (SUIT;
Diedrichsen, 2006) allowing us to bring the functional contrast images
(the weighted sums of single ␤-images) into a common template space,
resliced to 2 ⫻ 2 ⫻ 2 mm voxels. The normalized contrast images were
smoothed with a 3D Gaussian kernel (4 mm full-width at half-maxi-
mum; FWHM). Statistical analyses were performed using random-
effects analyses on these images.

For the whole-brain analysis, we normalized the anatomical images to
the MNI template using the unified segmentation and normalization
algorithm implemented in SPM8 (Ashburner and Friston, 2005). The
resulting transformation parameters were then applied to the functional
images. Images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM
and analyzed using the same GLM as was used in the cerebellum-specific
analysis.

We recognize that the presentation of single words can be sufficient to
generate predictions of, or prime, related words (Meyer and Schva-
neveldt, 1971); indeed, presentations of pairs of unrelated words elicits
an electrophysiological response (N400) associated with semantic pre-
diction errors (Ortu et al., 2013). Consequently, the Scrambled condition
is likely to involve predictions and prediction errors to some degree.
Note, however, that the crucial comparisons in the present study involve
the final target word and that extensive research on the N400 response
(for review, see Kutas and Federmeier, 2011) has shown that predictabil-
ity in higher level language structure (such as sentences or discourse) can
amplify and even override lower level priming effects (e.g., word-pair
associations or repetition priming). Based on these findings, we assume
that predictions generated in response to contextually isolated words in
the Scrambled condition are considerably weaker (i.e., less precise) than
the strong predictions generated after the presentation of the initial four
words in the Congruent and Incongruent conditions (see also the behav-

ioral validation of prediction strength, i.e., cloze probability, below).
Thus, our main focus for assessing predictions and violations of predic-
tions will be on the comparison of the Congruent and Incongruent
conditions.

Even though response speed was de-emphasized in the current exper-
iment, we expected we would observe reaction time (RT) differences
between the experimental conditions (Debruille and Renoult, 2009). RT
differences between conditions can influence the resulting activation pat-
terns in at least two ways (Grinband et al., 2008). First, neural activity
related to the actual response (motor preparation, sensory feedback) can
be shifted in time between short and long RTs, potentially affecting the
hemodynamic response to the preceding stimuli in differential ways.
Second, RT differences might reflect differences in time spent on the task,
leading to a larger summation of the BOLD response for conditions
associated with long RTs (Grinband et al., 2008). We addressed this issue
using a two-step approach. First, we included the single trial RTs as
additional regressors in the first-level analysis, using these values to mod-
ulate each of the four condition regressors. That is, each condition was
modeled by a constant regressor representing the task condition, and an
orthogonalized regressor that accounted for effects of trial-by-trial vari-
ability in RT. Second, since mean RT would still be reflected in the con-
stant condition regressor, we also calculated, on an individual basis, the
mean RT difference between any pair of contrasted conditions. The dif-
ference scores were then included as a covariate in the group analyses of
the contrast images. Importantly, this approach makes no assumptions
regarding the nature or consequences of RT differences (e.g., temporal
shift or differential time on task). Rather, the procedure assumes that, if
such differences do influence the BOLD response, these effects will be
captured in the regressors modeling trial-by-trial variability in RT, as well
as in the second-level covariates modeling mean RT-differences between
conditions.

A significance level of 5% (FDR corrected for multiple comparisons)
was adopted for all analyses. To this end, we set a voxelwise cluster-
forming threshold of p ⬍ 0.005 (uncorrected), with statistical signifi-
cance assessed by evaluating the volume of the active clusters (Chumbley
and Friston, 2009). Unthresholded statistical maps were uploaded to
the NeuroVault.org database and are available at http://neurovault.org/
collections/25/.
Results
Behavior
Overall accuracy across conditions was 96%, indicating that par-
ticipants judged congruent sentences as meaningful, and judged
incongruent sentences, scrambled words, and letter strings as
meaningless. As expected, RTs differed considerably across con-
ditions, (F(3,93) ⫽ 17.779, p ⬍ 0.0001). RTs were much faster in
the Congruent condition (mean: 704.3; SD: 260.3) compared
with the Incongruent condition (mean: 900.9; SD: 309.0). The
means for the Scrambled (mean: 783.7; SD: 358.4) and Letter
String conditions (mean: 807.3; SD: 227.7) fell between the
means for the congruent and incongruent conditions. Note that
participants in the scrambled and control condition could antic-
ipate their response well in advance of the target word.

RT effects on the BOLD signal
Figure 2a depicts regions in which the BOLD response was sen-
sitive to trial-to-trial variability in response time, averaged over
the four RT modulator regressors. This analysis revealed signifi-
cant positive relationships in a number of brain areas, indicating
a pattern of increased BOLD response with increased RT.
Consistent with previous studies, this effect was most evident
in medial frontal cortex (Yarkoni et al., 2009; Grinband et al.,
2011), as well as anterior insula, prefrontal and parietal cortices,
and several subcortical areas (Yarkoni et al., 2009). The
cerebellar-specific analysis confirmed RT-related effects in sev-
eral cerebellar clusters. No regions showed a negative relationship
between the BOLD response and RT.

bral activations in (b) the Letter String

String condition primarily activated areas
involved in visual perception and motor
control–including strong activations in
cerebellar lobules V and VIII. Areas showing
greater activation in the Scrambled condi-
tion compared with the Letter String condi-
tion were predominantly left-lateralized
cerebral areas associated with linguistic
processing (Price, 2010), as well as exten-
sive–primarily right-lateralized– cerebel-
lar activations.

Contextual priming effects on the
cerebellar BOLD response
Figure 3 and Table 1 show the results re-
lated to the core hypotheses of this study.
We first examined the effects of predict-
ability on the cerebellar BOLD signal by contrasting the Congru-
ent and Scrambled conditions (here and elsewhere, regressing
out the effect of RT). This analysis revealed a significant cluster in
the right posterior cerebellum, Crus I and II (Fig. 3a), with the
BOLD response larger when the context made the target word
predictable. While additional clusters were also observed in right
lobule IX and bilateral brainstem, these did not remain signifi-
cant when the analysis was restricted to sentences in which word
frequency was equated between conditions.

To examine the effects of violating predictions in sentence
comprehension, a contrast was performed between the Incon-

gruent and Congruent conditions. This analysis revealed greater ac-
tivation in the Incongruent condition across an extensive region of
the posterior cerebellum, bilaterally (Fig. 3b). We also looked at he-
modynamic correlates of prediction violations by comparing the
Incongruent and Scrambled conditions. Notably, in both of these
conditions the actual target word is unpredictable. However, only in
the Incongruent condition does the presentation of the target word
constitute a violation of a (strong) prediction, established by the
preceding context. Consistent with the contrast of the Incongruent
and Congruent conditions, cerebellar activation was stronger in the
Incongruent condition compared with the Scrambled condition,
and these effects were also bilateral (Fig. 3c).

similar pattern was observed in the con-
trast of the Incongruent versus the Con-
gruent condition, although the effects
were stronger and also extended into
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Contrast-
ing the Incongruent over the Scrambled
condition confirmed that violations of se-
mantic predictions produces a broad acti-
vation pattern, with the BOLD signal
significantly greater in superior medial
frontal cortex, bilateral inferior frontal
gyri, and lateral prefrontal cortex, as well
as in the left posterior middle temporal
gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and left angular
gyrus.
Discussion
Various lines of evidence have implicated
the cerebellum in language processing,
with the most compelling evidence com-
ing from an extensive body of neuroimag-
ing studies showing cerebellar activation
during a range of linguistic tasks (for re-
view, see Murdoch, 2010). Several func-
tional hypotheses have been proposed,
including ideas that highlight language-
specific functions such as the activation of
potential phonological codes (Nicolson et
al., 2001), covert articulation (Chen and
Desmond, 2005), and the coordination of lexical search (Des-
mond et al., 1998), to more generic ideas, for instance, concern-
ing a role for the cerebellum in supporting attentional shifts
(Allen et al., 1997). Here we build on the hypothesis that the
cerebellum plays a central role in predictive behavior, learning in-
ternal models that can be used to generate context-specific expectan-
cies (Ramnani, 2006), exploring a potential functional parallelism
across the domains of motor control and language. Our extension of
the internal model hypothesis to language is further grounded in the
observation that, despite its generative capacity, language is highly
redundant, with communication facilitated through the predictive
interactions between speaker and listener (Pickering and Garrod,
2007).

We tested this hypothesis using a contextual semantic priming
task. As hypothesized, the BOLD signal in the right posterior
cerebellum increased when the target word was predictable. We
recognize that, while cerebellar activation was modulated by pre-
dictability, the actual predictions could be generated elsewhere in

Figure 4.

Cerebral regions sensitive to contextual predictability.

In addition to providing an assay on prediction violations, the
comparison of the Incongruent and Scrambled conditions pro-
vides a second probe on regions correlated with the generation of
predictions, given the assumption that the first four words of the
Incongruent condition allows for the generation of a strong (but
violated) prediction, whereas the Scrambled condition does not.
As shown in Figure 3d, there was substantial spatial overlap be-
tween the Congruent ⬎ Scrambled and Incongruent ⬎ Scram-
bled contrasts, with the extent of activation greater in the latter
contrast.

Contextual priming effects on cerebral BOLD signal
Figure 4 and Table 2 present the results from the whole-brain
analysis for activations in the cerebral cortex. For the contrast
examining prediction generation, activation was greater in the
Congruent compared with Scrambled condition in bilateral su-
perior medial cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral su-

the brain; indeed, the whole-brain analysis revealed that a pre-
dictable linguistic context engaged a broad network of cortical
and subcortical areas (Fig. 4, Table 3). Importantly, Lesage et al.
(2012) recently provided compelling TMS evidence for a role of
the cerebellum in the generation of linguistic predictions. Partic-
ipants listened to spoken sentences and were required to look, as
quickly as possible, at one of four pictures that corresponded to
the last word. The sentences either provided a context that
strongly predicted the final word or created a context in which all
of the pictures were equally plausible. Crucially, repetitive TMS
applied over the right cerebellar hemisphere selectively slowed
saccade RTs in the predictive condition. A domain-general role of
the cerebellum in predictive functions is further supported by
studies demonstrating that patients with cerebellar lesions show
impairments on tests of predictive motor control (Bastian, 2006)
and abnormal effects of predictability on electrophysiological
measures of basic auditory processing (Knolle et al., 2012, 2013).
Our second main finding was the increased cerebellar activa-
tion when contextual expectancies were violated. Error-based
learning has been a central tenet of cerebellar computational the-
ories (Marr, 1969; Albus and Branch, 1971; Doya, 1999; Ito,
2006). Consistent with this idea, cerebellar patients show deficits
on sensorimotor adaptation tasks (Tseng et al., 2007), where er-
rors experienced during one trial lead to corrective adjustments
in the motor output on the next trial (Wolpert et al., 2011).
Furthermore, error-related increases in BOLD have been ob-
served in the cerebellum in studies of sensorimotor control
(Schlerf et al., 2012) and learning (Imamizu, 2000; Imamizu and
Kawato, 2012), as well as during the perception of visual se-
quences (Bubic et al., 2009). The present findings extend this line
of research by providing evidence for cerebellar error-related ac-
tivity during language processing. While not the main focus of
the current study, the cerebral activation patterns were in general
agreement with previous studies investigating the processing of
semantic violations (Lau et al., 2008).

The cerebellar results in our language task showed intriguing
similarities with those previously reported in an fMRI study of
sensorimotor learning (Fig. 3e; Imamizu et al., 2000). In the mo-
tor study, a spatially widespread activation pattern was observed
at the start of training, correlated with the magnitude of perfor-
mance errors. This activation decreased, both in intensity and
extent, with learning. However, even after prolonged learning–
and a stabilization of error magnitude–a focal area of activation
remained, which we attributed to the recruitment of an acquired
internal model (Fig. 3b). These results cannot be directly com-
pared with the present findings, given that language regularities
are highly overlearned, unlike the novel tool used in the Imamizu
study. Nonetheless, together, the results suggest similar cerebellar
activation dynamics across task domains.

The current findings are in general agreement with previous
studies of cerebellar involvement in language processing. As
noted above, Lesage et al. (2012) were able to disrupt anticipatory
responses due to sentential priming by applying rTMS over the
right cerebellar hemisphere. Using magnetic encephalography,
Kujala et al. (2007) found increased coherence between the cere-
bellum and the left temporal pole when participants read mean-
ingful sentences compared with reading the same words in
scrambled order. Similarly, an fMRI study reported increased
activation in the right posterior cerebellum when subjects read
sentences and narratives relative to the same words presented in
random sequences (Xu et al., 2005). In all of these studies, the
critical variable was the predictability of the presented words–
with increased cerebellar involvement for predictable relative to
unpredictable conditions.

More generally, neuroimaging (Stoodley and Schmahmann,
2009; Buckner et al., 2011) and neuroanatomical (Strick et al.,
2009) studies have linked the cerebellar areas activated in the
current study to higher cognitive function. For example, Balsters
et al. (2013) observed activation changes in these areas when
people were required to use abstract higher order rules. Rule-

based reasoning likely entails some degree of linguistic encoding.
Conversely, language, by its nature, entails complex, hierarchi-
cally nested representations, similar to the kinds of representa-
tions required for understanding abstract, higher order rules. An
interesting question for future research will be to design tasks that
seek to compare the internal model and rule representation hy-
potheses. Perhaps cerebellar activation observed when people are
asked to reason with complex rules reflects the operation of an
anticipatory thought process required to simulate possible out-
comes generated from a set of nested rules. Further, prediction is
a ubiquitous feature of nervous systems, a point emphasized in
the general theories of predictive coding (Rao and Ballard, 1999)
and the Bayesian brain (Friston, 2010). Thus, another important
set of remaining questions concerns the unique characteristics of
cerebellar predictive mechanisms. Current theoretical accounts–
based on microcircuit anatomy, neuroimaging, and patient stud-
ies–suggest context specificity (Ramnani, 2006), automaticity
(Ito, 2008), and precise timing (Ivry and Spencer, 2004) as po-
tential constraints for characterizing the predictive capabilities of
the cerebellum.

Some limitations with the present study need to be addressed.
First, word frequency differed between conditions, with higher
frequency words more likely to occur in the final position in the
scrambled condition. However, we find it unlikely that the results
can be attributed to word frequency effects since the main re-
ported findings remained significant in the control analyses. Sec-
ond, since we used fixed stimulus intervals, the BOLD response to
the preceding sentence might have influenced the BOLD re-
sponse to the target word. However, this cannot account for the
difference between the incongruent and congruent sentences as
these conditions only differed with respect to the final target
word.

Third, the RT differences across conditions raise the possibil-
ity that the cerebellar activations were more related to differences
in motor preparation than to differences in language processing.
We addressed this concern by including trial-by-trial RTs and
condition RT differences in the analyses, a procedure which
proved sufficiently sensitive to detect effects of RT variability,
including within some cerebellar foci. Nonetheless, the cerebellar
activations related to both linguistic predictability as well as vio-
lations of linguistic predictions remained reliable even when we
included the RT data as regressors in our model. Moreover, the
cerebellar activations associated with word predictability were
located in areas more closely associated with cognitive functions
than motor control (Stoodley and Schmahmann, 2009).

Fourth, we recognize that word predictability is confounded,
to some extent, with other variables; for example, predictable
sentences are also likely to be experienced as more meaningful
and incongruent target words are likely to not only generate an
error signal, but also engage brain areas involved in sentence
comprehension. Future studies will be required to examine the
relationships between such variables as prediction, meaningful-
ness, error processing, and comprehension. We note, however,
that our interpretation is consistent with results from numerous
studies of cerebellar contributions to language, perception, and
motor control. Thus, while alternative explanations cannot be
conclusively ruled out, we believe that the generation of predic-
tions in the cerebellum constitutes the most parsimonious ac-
count of the present findings.

Finally, and perhaps most challenging, the current results,
along with those obtained in numerous other imaging studies
demonstrating cerebellar activations during language tasks, stand
in apparent contradiction to the clinical literature. Pronounced

language comprehension deficits are not observed in patients
with acquired cerebellar pathology (Alexander et al., 2012). How-
ever, it is important to note that the motor deficits observed in
ataxia tend to become most evident during complex movements.
By analogy, cerebellar predictions might aid, but in a strict sense
not be essential for, language comprehension. As a case in point,
while words can certainly be understood when presented alone,
presenting them within a predictive context significantly aids com-
prehension; for instance, prediction can increase reading speed by
allowing the reader to skip predictable words, or facilitate compre-
hension in noisy environments (Pickering and Garrod, 2007). Fu-
ture neuropsychological studies should investigate the effects of
cerebellar lesions on language comprehension in more complex
contexts (such as noisy environments) or by comparing conditions
in which the degree of predictability is manipulated.

In conclusion, we found that the predictability of visually pre-
sented words modulated the BOLD response in the posterior
cerebellum. The observed activation patterns matched our ex-
pectations based on previous imaging studies of internal models
in sensorimotor control. Thus our results are in line with the idea
of a generalized role for the cerebellum in encoding internal
models, a hypothesis that offers a unified perspective on cerebel-
lar function in motor and non-motor tasks.
