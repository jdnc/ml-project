Reading is a fundamental human capacity and yet it can easily be derailed by the
simple act of mind-wandering. A large-scale brain network, referred to as the default
mode network (DMN), has been shown to be involved in both mind-wandering and
reading, raising the question as to how the same neural system could be implicated
in processes with both costs and beneﬁts to narrative comprehension. Resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to explore whether the
intrinsic functional connectivity of the two key midline hubs of the DMN—the posterior
cingulate cortex (PCC) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC)—was predictive
of individual differences in reading comprehension and task focus recorded outside of
the scanner. Worse comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity
between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum. Better comprehension was
associated with greater functional connectivity with a region of the right insula. By
contrast reports of increasing task focus were associated with functional connectivity
from the aMPFC to clusters in the PCC, the left parietal and temporal cortex, and
the cerebellum. Our results suggest that the DMN has both costs (such as poor
comprehension) and beneﬁts to reading (such as an on-task focus) because its midline
core can couple its activity with other regions to form distinct functional communities
that allow seemingly opposing mental states to occur. This ﬂexible coupling allows the
DMN to participate in cognitive states that complement the act of reading as well as
others that do not.

INTRODUCTION
The development of writing has profoundly changed our social
world: it allows ideas to be publicized to geographically diverse
groups of individuals and permits concepts to be passed from
generation to generation. More prosaically, but no less impor-
tantly, reading is a source of enjoyment available to every literate
individual. Despite the value of reading, it can often seem that
our minds are ill suited to the task of narrative comprehension. It
is relatively common during reading, for example, to experience
thoughts and feelings that are unrelated to the prose in front of
us. Such task-unrelated thinking occurs across many task contexts
(Smallwood and Schooler, 2006) and when it occurs in read-
ing is a well-documented correlate of comprehension problems
(Schooler et al., 2004; Smallwood et al., 2008; Franklin et al., 2011;

McVay and Kane, 2011). At present we lack a detailed appreciation
of the processes that govern how our thoughts are constrained to
the narrative of a piece of prose, or those that cause our minds to
wander away from what we are reading.

The current study used resting-state functional magnetic res-
onance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate whether variations in
the experience of reading across individuals have a basis in the
brain’s functional architecture. We were particularly interested in
how the reading experience of different individuals varied with
the behavior of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC)
and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), two major midline hubs of
the default mode network (DMN; Raichle et al., 2001; Greicius
and Menon, 2004; Buckner et al., 2008; Andrews-Hanna et al.,
2010). The DMN is a constellation of brain regions including

regions of prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortex that were
initially discovered to “deactivate” during externally driven tasks,
and also exhibit correlated intrinsic neural activity. The DMN
consists of a midline core that includes the aMPFC and the PCC
that can ﬂexibly couple its activity to two additional subsystems:
(i) a medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem that includes the
hippocampus, the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and the temporal
poles, and is important in episodic memory; and (ii) a dorsal
subsystem that includes a dorsal region of the medial prefrontal
cortex and lateral regions of the parietal cortex including the
temporoparietal junction, and may be important in simulating of
self and other (Buckner et al., 2008; Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010).
Currently the functions of the DMN are a matter of debate:
prior studies have documented that the DMN plays a role in
task-unrelated thought in sustained attention tasks (Mason et al.,
2007; Christoff et al., 2009; Stawarczyk et al., 2011) as well as
absent-minded lapses (Eichele et al., 2008; Christoff et al., 2009),
suggesting that activity in this network could be responsible for
the comprehension deﬁcits that occur when the mind wanders
during reading. Given that the DMN is implicated in task-
unrelated thinking, it would seem intuitive that this network
would be responsible for failures in comprehension that accrue
due to mind-wandering.

Despite the appeal of the account of the DMN as the sub-
strate for task-unrelated thought, the picture is likely to be more
complicated: regions of the DMN have also been implicated
in processes that are likely to be engaged during reading. For
example, Fletcher et al. (1995) demonstrated that reading stories
containing a narrative relating to either physical reality or to
the mental states of other individuals activated the PCC relative
to a series of unlinked sentences. Additionally, grey matter vol-
ume in the PCC is correlated with an individual’s capacity for
phonological decoding (He et al., 2013). Recent meta-analyses
have conﬁrmed the role of the PCC and aMPFC in extended
narrative comprehension, especially of a ﬁctional nature (Mar,
2011).

Functional studies suggest the DMN is also implicated in
processes that readers could use when reading. For example, the
DMN is activated when participants make mental state attribu-
tions (Spreng et al., 2009; Spreng and Mar, 2012), when they
retrieve information from memory (Huijbers et al., 2011), and
has been hypothesized to allow for multiple different mental
states all of which rely on information from memory to guide
behavior (Smallwood et al., 2013). Meta-analyses also indicate
that elements of the DMN are important in semantic processing:
a capacity which is critical for reading (Binder and Desai, 2011).
Semantic processing, mental state attribution, and the retrieval
of information from memory are all abilities that are important
in narrative comprehension because they allow the reader to
understand the motives of characters and to make links between
different elements of an extended text.

To understand why the DMN could be implicated in both
costs and beneﬁts to reading (Smallwood, 2013), we recorded how
effectively individuals stayed on task while they read three differ-
ent expository texts from an engaging popular work describing
the history of science as well as the lives of the protagonists who
contributed to this story. Afterwards participants completed a set

of open-ended questions assessing their comprehension of what
they read. Previously recorded rs-fMRI data was also available
from a subset of these individuals which we used to explore how
trait differences in the effectiveness of reading, measured both
subjectively and objectively, were related to differences in the
intrinsic functional connectivity of two of the major hubs of the
DMN (aMPFC and PCC).

Based on prior evidence of DMN activation associated both
with processes engaged by reading and with mind-wandering, as
well as evidence that mind-wandering during reading is associated
with poorer reading performance, we predicted that differences
in reading effectiveness would relate to distinct patterns of func-
tional connectivity between the midline core of the DMN and
other brain regions. Prior studies have looked at how the behav-
ior of resting state networks associated with reading behavior
(Koyama et al., 2011), here we report an rs-fMRI investigation
that is focused on the DMN. We used hypothesis driven seed-
based analysis to examine whether metrics of reading behavior
modulate the whole-brain connectivity of these regions. We were
particularly interested in whether any observed modulations of
functional connectivity could help shed light on how the DMN
can be both beneﬁcial and costly to the act of reading. Although
this approach is limited by our choice of seed regions, it does not
constrain the results of our analysis and so provides a straightfor-
ward, hypothesis driven method to assess our question of interest
(Cole et al., 2010).

METHODS
Healthy participants were recruited for the current experiment
from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain
Sciences participant database. Ethical approval was obtained prior
to completing this experiment from the Ethics committee of
the University of Leipzig (Ref # 360-10-13122010). Participants
provided written informed consent prior to their participation.

ASSESSMENT OF READING BEHAVIOR
Individual differences in maintaining focus on the narrative while
reading and subsequent text comprehension was assessed in a
sample of 61 healthy native German speakers (age range = 19–
50, mean = 27.9 years, (SD = 5) 37 females, all right handed)
while they read three excerpts from the ofﬁcial translation of Bill
Bryson’s A Short History of Everything, a text that has been used in
English language studies of mind-wandering (Smallwood et al.,
2009b; Smilek et al., 2010). These texts are engaging non-ﬁction
works that describes the characters and historical contexts of
important scientiﬁc events. One text dealt with biology, a second
with chemistry and a third dealt with geology. On average each
text was approximately 1200 words long (mean = 1187). The
Fleisch Kincaid levels were calculated using an online website1
and ranged from 34–39 making these texts slightly easier than
university level material.

Participants read each text on a computer screen in an indi-
vidual testing booth. Text was presented one sentence at a time
and participants received experience sampling probes at random
intervals (5–7 times for each text). Reading was self-paced and

lasted approximately one hour in total. Experience sampling
probes asked participants to report whether, at the moment prior
to the probe, they were focused on what they were reading or
on something else, a phenomenon described as task-unrelated
thought (“Dachten Sie an die Aufgabe oder an etwas anderes?”).
Participants answered this probe using a slider operated via a
mouse. At the end of each text participants were asked about their
familiarity with the text measured using a similar slider as was
used to assess task focus.

After each text, comprehension of the material was assessed
using a set of open-ended paper and pencil questions. On average
participants took approximately 15 (±5) min to read each text
and approximately the same time for answer the questions.

MRI ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS
rs-fMRI scans of 42 participants (age range = 19–26, mean = 27
years, 21 females) were retrieved from the existing Max Planck
Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences participant
database. The scans were collected on either a 3.0 Tesla Siemens
Tim Trio (n = 26) or a Siemens Vario scanner (n = 16) before the
reading assessment. Scanning duration varied from 360–600 s and
two different slice order acquisitions were employed (ascending,
n = 38, interleaved, n = 4). For all participants, the remaining
parameters were the same (Repetition Times (TR) = 2000 ms;
Echo Time (TE) = 30 ms; ﬂip angle = 90◦; s acquisition matrix =
64 × 64; Field of view (FOV) = 192 mm; acquisition voxel size =
3 × 3 × 4 mm). Participants were instructed to relax, to hold as
still as possible, and to keep their eyes open. High-resolution T1-
weighted anatomical scans were also acquired for all participants
(MPRAGE, TR = 2300 ms; TE = 2.96 ms; TI = 900 ms; ﬂip angle
= 9◦; FOV = 256 mm; acquisition voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm).
FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY ANALYSIS
Preprocessing, seed selection, and time series extraction
Cortical surface reconstruction was performed on the T1 scans
using FreeSurfer (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 2001, 2002,
2004; Behzadi et al., 2007; Reuter et al., 2010). For each subject,
nonlinear transformation from T1 to MNI template (created
from 152 subjects, resampled at 2 mm, provided with FSL) was
calculated using Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs; Avants
et al., 2011).

To remove potential scanner instability effects the ﬁrst
four volumes of each echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence
were removed. This was followed by simultaneous slice-timing
and motion correction using 4DRealign implemented in nipy2
(Roche, 2011). Afﬁne transformation from mean EPI image to
T1 volume was calculated using BB Register (Greve and Fischl,
2009). Brain mask, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) mask and white
matter (WM) mask were extracted from FreeSurfer parcella-
tion and transformed into EPI space (thresholded at 0.5 after
interpolation). Realigned timeseries were masked using the brain
mask. Principal components of physiological noise were estimated
using the CompCor (Behzadi et al., 2007). Joined WM and CSF
masks and voxels of highest variance were used to extract two
sets of principal components (a.k.a. aCompCor and tCompCor).

Using both of those strategies ensures robust estimation of phys-
iological noise. Outliers in the EPI sequence were discovered
based on intensity and motion parameters (ArtDetect).3 This
was followed by denoising of the time-series using a general
linear model (GLM) model with motion parameters, CompCorr
components, and outliers as regressors (note that global signal
was not regressed). Time-series were also smoothed using SUSAN
with 5 mm full width half minimum (FWHM) kernel (Smith,
1992). Finally high pass (0.1 Hz) and low pass (0.01 Hz) ﬁlters
were applied using FSL. Quality of scans and preprocessing was
assessed visually by looking at EPI to T1 coregistration overlay,
motion parameters plots and temporal signal to noise ratio vol-
umes (tSNR).

To estimate connectivity from aMPFC and PCC, we selected
spherical regions of interest (ROIs) of 6 mm radius with centers
at MNI (x, y, z) from left aMPFC =− 6, 52, −2, right aMPFC
= 6, 52, −2, left PCC =− 8, −56, 26, and right PCC = 8,
−56, 26. These correspond to the major hubs of the DMN
in the left hemisphere as reported by Andrews-Hanna et al.
(2010) and we transformed them to the right hemisphere to
reﬂect the fact that the DMN has a complex bilateral struc-
ture in normal healthy controls (Swanson et al., 2011). ROI
masks were transformed back to each subject’s EPI space using
combined inverse nonlinear MNI to T1 transform and afﬁne
T1 to EPI (thresholded after interpolation at 0.5). Translated
ROIs were restricted within the brain mask. ROIs time-series
were estimated by averaging voxels within each ROI. Full brain
connectivity (correlation) maps were calculated using analy-
sis of functional neuroimages (AFNI). Connectivity maps were
Fisher’s r-to-z transformed and spatially transformed to MNI
space for group-level analysis. Finally, these maps were averaged
to provide an average connectivity maps for both regions across
hemispheres. These averaged maps were used in the subsequent
analysis.

Preprocessing was performed with a workﬂow from
Brain Imaging Pipelines4 and all data processing integrated
using Nipype (Gorgolewski et al., 2011). Code used for
generating connectivity maps is available at https://github.
com/NeuroanatomyAndConnectivity/pipelines/tree/reading_by_
default/src/reading_by_default. Unthresholded statistical maps
have been uploaded to NeuroVault.org and are available at
http://neurovault.org/collections/59.

Analysis strategy
The answers to comprehension questions were scored according
to an agreed rating system by two independent raters who were
blind to the other’s rating and showed high agreement (> 90%).
The resulting average scores for each question showed reasonable
inter-item agreement (Cronbachs Alpha = 0.78). For each partici-
pant, an overall comprehension score was computed by averaging
the scores obtained across all questions.

For the behavioral analysis we used a linear mixed model
(LMM) as implemented in statistical package for the social sci-
ences (SPSS) to examine how the subjective experience while

Reading by default

reading was related to the objective measure of comprehension.
Building on prior research detailing that poor comprehension
can be a marker for task unrelated thought, we predicted the
subjective reports of participants based on their comprehension
of what they were reading. LMMs allow the comparison of predic-
tors recorded on multiple occasions within different participants
in a single model and so allowed us to assess whether variation
in task focus within an individual and between different texts is
associated with changes in comprehension level. In this analysis
the participant was treated as a random effect, the task focus
score was the dependent variable and the comprehension of what
was read was included as a continuous independent factor. We
also included age and gender as ﬁxed factors in this model. We
recruited a larger number of subjects for the behavioral element of
the study to ensure that the relationships described were as robust
as possible.

For the rs-fMRI analysis, SPM8 was used to perform a second-
level random effects analysis of the patterns of connectivity from
each ROI. This model included two between-participant regres-
sors for each seed region: (i) reports of subjective focus during
reading and (ii) average comprehension of the information read
in the text. Scan length was also included in the model as a
nuisance regressor. To perform inference we used the topological
False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach (Chumbley et al, 2010):
(1) statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.01 (uncorrected) to
deﬁne clusters; (2) the probability of the size of each cluster (given
the search space, smoothness, and cluster forming threshold) was
calculated using Random Field Theory (Worsley et al., 1992);
(3) Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to these p-values
to maintain FDR (of clusters) at 5% level (Chumbley et al,
2010). These maps reﬂect the relationship between subjective and
objective measures of reading behavior and the modulations of
the intrinsic functional architecture of two key seeds of the DMN.
In order to create scatter plots, the beta weights of the peak voxel
from the cluster identiﬁed by the group-level analysis were calcu-
lated for each individual using SPM. To account for the different
scanning sequences that our participants had we included three
nuisance regressors: scanner type (1 or 0), scanning length in
volumes (range 180–300), and slice-timing order scheme (1 or 0).

RESULTS
BEHAVIORAL RESULTS
Comprehension was acceptable for each text (see Figure 1). Prior
to analysis, all variables were z-transformed. The LMM revealed
the expected positive relationship between higher ratings of task
related focus when participants read a text when their subse-
quent comprehension was higher (F(1, 171.83) = 4.37, p < 0.05,
t(171.83) = 2.09). This indicates that within participant changes
in task focus while reading can be predicted based on whether a
participant was successfully able to answer comprehension ques-
tions on the material presented during the period when attention
was sampled (Smallwood et al., 2008). Neither age nor gender
were associated with differences in task focus (all p-values < 0.3).
We repeated this analysis including a participant’s familiarity with
the text, and this did not appreciably alter the main effect of
comprehension on task focus (F(1, 137.59) = 3.89, p = 0.051,
t(137.59) = 1.97), nor was there an effect of familiarity on ratings

FIGURE 1 | Group level behavioral results. The group average for the
comprehension ranged from .5 to .7 across the three texts, indicating that
the measure was not a ﬂoor nor at ceiling. This is summarized in Panel (A).
LMMs comparing the within participant variation in comprehension and
task focus indicated that on texts when comprehension was higher,
participants reported better task focus. This is summarized in Panel (B) in
which the parameter estimates extracted from the LMMs were used to
estimate the task focus at one standard deviation above and below the
mean. In both panels the error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.

of task focus or an interaction with comprehension (for both
comparisons p-values < 0.3).

For the purpose of the group-level fMRI analysis we calculated
individual differences in comprehension for each individual,
as well as in the maintenance of task focus on what was read.
Boxplot analysis indicated that one individual was an outlier on
the measure of task focus, and this score was manually replaced
with a score that was adjacent to the next highest score. At the
group-level, comprehension and task focus were uncorrelated
(r =− 0.06, p = 0.667).
FUNCTIONAL IMAGING RESULTS
The connectivity patterns of the seed regions used in the current
analysis are presented visually in Figure 2. These maps are thresh-
olded with a T-value of +/−3 and provide a visualization of the
patterns of connectivity upon which our subsequent analyses are
based. Table 1 presents the results of the group level analyses.

COMPREHENSION
A whole brain search of the connectivity of PCC indicated that
it was modulated by comprehension. Decreasing comprehension
was associated with greater connectivity with a cluster between
the PCC and the ventral striatum / amygdala. This can be seen
in Figure 3. By contrast, as comprehension increased across indi-
viduals within our sample we found greater connectivity between
the PCC and the right anterior insula (AI). Connectivity with
aMPFC did not vary signiﬁcantly with either better or worse
comprehension.

TASK FOCUS
We found that aMPFC connectivity was modulated by better
task focus. With increasing task focus, aMPFC exhibited greater

left parietal cortex, and a third cluster in the temporal cortex.
aMPFC connectivity was also higher with two clusters within the
cerebellum for individuals who stayed on task. These clusters are
presented in Figure 4.

DISCUSSION
Our rs-fMRI examination suggests that variations in reading
behavior are reﬂected by relatively complex associations with the
connectivity patterns of both PCC and aMPFC. Although the
objective (comprehension) and subjective (reports of task focus)
indicators were uncorrelated at the group-level, our analysis using

a LMM indicated that the measures were sensitive to within
participant variance in the constructs measured. This suggests
that ﬂuctuations in task focus, and narrative comprehension
showed a pattern of common variation within the individuals
in our sample. At a group level we found that a more on task
focus during reading was associated with greater functional con-
nectivity between the aMPFC and the posterior cingulate and
the precuneus, the left angular gyrus and temporal lobe, and
the cerebellum. Although this result may seem contradictory
with respect to the known role of the DMN in task-unrelated
thought (e.g., Mason et al., 2007), this interpretation is consistent
with evidence reviewed in the introduction that this network is

the DMN (−48, −68, 28) (Seghier et al., 2010; Seghier and Price,
2012). If this region can participate in both semantic and DMN
processes, it could afford the integration of processes supported
by both systems. This could be one reason why we ﬁnd greater
connectivity between the aMPFC and this region with increasing
on task reports across individuals: the ability to integrate semantic
information with processes supported by the DMN would allow
participants to build a richer model of what they are reading
which would thus support an attentive focus on what is being
read.

Comprehension was associated with differences in PCC func-
tional connectivity. We found that better comprehension was
associated with greater functional connectivity between the PCC
and the right AI. Along with the anterior cingulate, these regions
participate in what is known as the saliency network (Seeley
et al., 2007). Our observation that individuals who have good
comprehension shows heightened coupling between the right AI
and the PCC is consistent with the notion that the saliency net-
work plays an important role in coordinating the DMN (Menon
and Uddin, 2010). For example, individuals with fronto-temporal
dementia disease do not recruit the DMN when engaged in
moral reasoning, a result that is thought to occur because of a
diminished inﬂuence of the saliency network on DMN function
(Chiong et al., 2013). Similarly, traumatic brain injury disrupts
ongoing task performance in a go/no-go task due to a failure
to deactivate the DMN, which occurs because of deﬁcits in the
integrity of WM tracts linking the hubs of the saliency network
(anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and AI). We hypothesize that the
heightened coupling between the PCC and the right AI we observe
could reﬂect a signature of an individual who can exert control
over the processes served by the DMN which in turn would allow
them to maximize their performance on tasks which require this
network (such as reading). Interestingly, the right AI has been
identiﬁed as the entry point of information into the saliency
network, a ﬁnding which could explain why we ﬁnd evidence in
its connectivity with the PCC (Ham et al., 2013).

By contrast, worse comprehension was associated with greater
coupling between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum
and this region is known to provide strong motivational signals
that guide learning and behavior (Liljeholm and O’Doherty,
2012) and prior resting-state functional connectivity experiments
have shown that this region of inferior ventral striatum shows a
pattern of robust connectivity to PCC that more superior areas
of the ventral striatum do not (Di Martino et al., 2008). Studies
have found that activity in the ventral striatum exhibit reduced
deactivation during cognitive tasks when individuals with atten-
tion deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are off medication,
which is argued to result from motivational problems (Peterson
et al., 2009). Individuals with ADHD also tend to show greater
educational problems (Kuriyan et al., 2013), as well as greater
mind-wandering (Shaw and Giambra, 1993). Recent studies have
also found increased connectivity between the striatum and the
PCC in adolescents with major depression (Gabbay et al., 2013),
an observation that is relevant because greater mind-wandering
and worse performance on objective measures of performance
are correlates of states of dysphoria (Smallwood et al., 2007b),
negative affect (Smallwood et al., 2009a) as well as clinical depres-

involved in processes necessary for narrative comprehension, as
well as more general evidence that integrity within the DMN is
predictive of better rather than worse task performance (Kelly
et al., 2008).

Objective variations in performance tracked with variations in
connectivity of the PCC seed: as comprehension decreased across
individuals we saw greater coupling between PCC and a cluster
of subcortical regions including the inferior ventral striatum. By
contrast, increasing comprehension was associated with greater
coupling between the PCC and the right AI. Subjective descrip-
tions of experience during reading varied with the connectivity
of the aMPFC. As task focus increased across participants, the
aMPFC showed greater coupling with a region of the posterior
cingulate that overlapped with our seed region. This indicates that
functional integrity within the midline core of the DMN is higher
for people who stay focused during reading.

We also found evidence that suggests that an on task focus
during reading is associated with greater coupling between the
DMN and neural regions that support semantic processing. Indi-
viduals with higher on task reports exhibited greater connectivity
between the aMPFC and a cluster in the left parietal cortex
extending into the left angular gyrus and a second cluster that
extended ventrally down the left temporal lobe and encompassed
the hippocampus. The temporal lobe, especially on the left, is
known to play an important role in semantic processes involved in
language comprehension (Binder and Desai, 2011). Furthermore,
grey matter volume is larger in a region of left parietal cortex for
individuals who are especially competent at phonological decod-
ing (He et al., 2013). In addition, the dorsal terminus of the cluster
we identiﬁed in the parietal cortex (−45, −68, 26) is adjacent
to the peak voxel of a region that has recently be found to be
commonly activated by semantic tasks, as well as participating in

sion (Watts et al., 1988). Taken together we hypothesize that the
pattern of heightened connectivity between PCC and striatum
may be a neural signature that signiﬁes problems in external
task performance, perhaps due to motivational difﬁculties in
assigning value to an external task (see also Mason et al., 2013).
Support for this motivational account comes from experiments
that show that performance-related ﬁnancial reward improves
performance and does so by reducing mind-wandering (Mrazek
et al., 2012).

Our study found that the intrinsic functional connectivity
of the two midline hubs of the DMN, and in particular the
PCC, was such that they were capable of producing contrasting
cognitive states: our results implicated the PCC in the production
of distinctive, often opposing cognitive states (e.g., better and
worse comprehension) through its cooperation with spatially
distinct regions of the brain. The PCC is part of a highly corrected
rich club of core nodes (Zuo et al., 2012; Sporns, 2013) that are
more densely interconnected than would be expected by chance
(van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011) and many of the short
communication paths within the brain go through one or more
of its members (Harriger et al., 2012). These anatomical features
would allow a neural region to control the dissemination of a large
amount of neural communication (Sporns, 2013) and so would
explain the PCC’s participation in different neural communities
serving oppossing cognitive functions. It is noteworthy that we
found that the the PCC either showed greater functional con-
nectivity with the AI or the caudate/putamen depending on the
level of a participants reading comprehension: all three of these
regions are members of the rich club (van den Heuvel and Sporns,
2011).

In practical terms we demonstrated that rs-fMRI can be used
to gain a functional description of the brain organization asso-
ciated with reading behavior and it could be possible to use this
approach in the future to understand attentional problems related
to mind-wandering during reading (Smallwood et al., 2007a). For
example, changing patterns of connectivity between regions of the
DMN could provide an additional outcome measure for evaluat-
ing interventions that target improving educational achievement
in individuals with difﬁculties in reading. Ultimately, given its
sensitivity to individual differences in reading comprehension,
rs-fMRI could even provide a method for the diagnosis of the
speciﬁc functional problems that individuals have with reading
problems.

Although our results are encouraging, the relatively small
sample size (Yarkoni, 2009) means that our results must be treated
with caution until they are replicated with a larger number of
participants. Also, it should be noted that the LMM indicated
the expected relationship between objective and subjective indica-
tors of reading comprehension within participants. However, our
rs-fMRI analysis is only focused on between participant differ-
ences. This prevents us from clearly dissociating the trait of mind-
wandering while reading from the state of mind that occurs
when our thoughts drift from what we were reading to task-
unrelated concerns. To address this issue it would be necessary
to acquire fMRI data with while reading is taking place, or at
least using multiple sessions of both reading and rs-fMRI data
on the same day. Also, it is important to note that we conducted

a targeted investigation of the two key hubs of the DMN, and
so our study does not provide any information on the behavior
of other regions of the DMN or of the resting-state more gener-
ally.

In terms of the implications of our results for understanding
the neural basis of reading, we suggest caution when consider-
ing the generality of our results. Given the complexity of tasks
such as narrative comprehension, we expect that there are likely
important boundary conditions on how the DMN contributes to
this behavior. For example, it has been shown that this network
exhibits greater negative correlation with the left fusiform gyrus
for adults who read effectively, as assessed by capacities such
as phonological expertise, whereas this relationship is reversed
in children (Koyama et al., 2011). These results suggest that
experience or age may inﬂuence the links between resting-state
dynamics and reading abilities. Other studies have shown that
patterns of connectivity predicting reading performance occur
at multiple spatial scales (Wang et al., 2013), suggesting that the
sub-components of large scale networks (such as the DMN) may
play different roles during different phases of reading. It is also
important to bear in mind that the neural processes engaged
during reading can vary dependent on the texts factual or ﬁctional
composition (Altmann et al., 2012). Altogether such evidence
suggests that for maximum relevance to educational research it
would be valuable for future studies to examine the functional
architecture that supports differences in reading experience for
texts that vary on their narrative characteristics, as well as inves-
tigating how dynamics vary with the expertise of the reader.
Both of these questions may also beneﬁt from collecting neural
data when participants are engaged in the act of reading. While
these limitations provide an important caveat on our results, our
data is nonetheless an important step in understanding the links
between subjective experience and objective indicators of reading
experience and their related neural correlates.

Finally, these data provide a plausible answer to the question
that motivated this research in the ﬁrst place: Why should the
DMN be implicated in both costs and beneﬁts to reading? We found
that the mutual connectivity of the midline core of the DMN was
such that it produced contrasting cognitive states. The aMPFC
exhibited increasing coupling to a region of the PCC (encompass-
ing the seed regions we used in our analysis) more for participants
who reported maintaining focus on what they read. The PCC seed
was more functionally coupled to the striatum for individuals who
performed poorly on tests of comprehension, and more coupled
to the AI for those who did well. Based on these data we can
rule out simple accounts of the DMN as supporting either task-
unrelated thought or successful reading. Instead we propose a
novel hypothesis for why narrative comprehension suffers when
the mind wanders (Schooler et al., 2004; Smallwood et al., 2008;
Franklin et al., 2011; McVay and Kane, 2011): mind-wandering
interferes with reading comprehension because it engages regions
of the DMN that are also important in making sense of what
is being read. This competitive hypothesis assumes that there
are common processes that underlie an individual’s capability to
make sense of what they are reading, which are also engaged by
task-unrelated thinking. Whether the DMN helps or hinders the
act of reading, therefore, may depend on whether its midline core
